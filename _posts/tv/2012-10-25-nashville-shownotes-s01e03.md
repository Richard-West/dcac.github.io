<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong><em>Dear Cast and Crew of Nashville,</em></strong><em> S1E03 &ndash; &ldquo;Someday You&rsquo;ll Call My Name&rdquo;</em></span></p>
<p><em>Episode synopsis:</em><br />Rayna discovers the depth of the financial problems she and Teddy face. Elsewhere, Juliette&#8217;s mom comes back into her life; Juliette tempts Deacon with a contract offer; and Scarlett and Gunnar&#8217;s shot at stardom is jeopardized.</p>
<p><em>Original air date:</em><br />October 24, 2012</p>
<p><em>Shownotes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I need to see this tie with horseshoes that a Nashville man can only refer to as having &ldquo;little U&rsquo;s&rdquo;. </li>
<li>I <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">do not</span> need to see the side-boob of seventh graders that Rayna&rsquo;s daughter is referring to.</li>
<li><em>I Will Fall </em>for Scarlett and Gunner pretty darn fast with songs like that.</li>
<li>Juliette thinks &ldquo;processed cheese&rdquo; is the good stuff. It&rsquo;s a cheesy metaphor about her music!</li>
<li>Why does the <em>Nashville</em> font change at the end of the opening title sequence? Who&rsquo;s writing the branding standards for this show? Fired!</li>
<li>Radio Announcer: &ldquo;Rayna James cut that track back in 19&hellip;&rdquo; cut off! A lady never reveals the age of her music.</li>
<li>Will that beautiful brick archway in the kitchen be enough to hold up Rayana and Teddy&rsquo;s unstable home life? I say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; </li>
<li>Starts with &ldquo;Ray&rdquo;, ends in &ldquo;Ayna&rdquo;? Help me out, Juliette. Your code is too elaborate.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Go home. Go the hell. But don&rsquo;t you stay here.&rdquo; Aaaaaand storm off!&nbsp; Perfect Rayna, just like you rehearsed every other episode. </li>
<li><em>Nashville</em> is already covering it&rsquo;s own songs. If those two girls in the talent show weren&rsquo;t so damn cute, I might complain.</li>
<li>Sounds like your momma was a two-timer too, Rayna. That&rsquo;ll inspire a song. Maybe even a new one.</li>
<li>Rich = driving your car from your house to your own front gate. To see your drug-addict mother.</li>
<li>Avery just <em>whisked</em> Scarlett off her feet. Get it? Food processing is a very important metaphor in this episode. </li>
<li>Crazy mama drama just got picked up for future episodes, as Juliette&rsquo;s mom moves in. </li>
<li>Someone get props master Tommy Tomlinson to turn Rayna&rsquo;s final park pose into a statue called &ldquo;The Over-Thinker&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Someone also tell Tommy Tomlinson his name should be used in the show.</li>
<li>Drink every time the line <em>Fade Into You</em> is synced with an editing crossfade in this final montage: Chug! Chug! Chug!&#8230;</li>
<li>The final cliffhanger is a real nail biter about nail polish. I see what you did there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Closing comments: Three episodes in, and the show was risking already being a greatest hits version of the first two. But a couple of new tracks by the show&rsquo;s true singing talents (Sam Palladio and Care Bowen) kept the show feeling like a hit. Is it not painfully obvious that Rayna will go on tour with Juliette and this whole &ldquo;will he or won&rsquo;t he&rdquo; dilemma with Deacon become moot?&#8230;</p>
