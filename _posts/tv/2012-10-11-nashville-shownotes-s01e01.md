<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong><em>Dear Cast and Crew of Nashville,</em></strong><em> S01E01 &ndash; &ldquo;Pilot&rdquo;</em></span></p>
<p><em>Original air date:</em><br />October 10, 2012</p>
<p><em>Episode synopsis:</em><br />Fading country superstar Rayna James is forced to team up with teen sensation Juliette Barnes or face the loss of her tour and promotion of her latest records. Rayna&#8217;s father, Lamar, disregards her wishes when he backs her husband in a run for mayor of Nashville.</p>
<p><em>Shownotes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Give casting director Jeanie Bacharach a raise &ndash; amazing job. &nbsp;(CR)</li>
<li>&nbsp;Is this music on iTunes yet? Okay, good. (CR)</li>
<li>&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t let T-Bone Burnett divorce series creator Callie Khouri or the show&rsquo;s in trouble (CR)</li>
<li>&nbsp;The Juliette Barnes character is not inspired by Taylor Swift. Nope, not at all. (CR)</li>
<li>&nbsp;More of those rich, gravel throat threats from Powers Booth please! (CR)</li>
<li>&nbsp;So many characters, and already so well developed. (CR)</li>
<li>&nbsp;No melodramatic outbust when Deacon tells Rayna he might join Juliette&rsquo;s tour? I could get used to&nbsp; this. (CR)</li>
<li>&nbsp;The husband&rsquo;s name is Teddy, and he&rsquo;s cute like a Teddy bear. #nailedit (CR)</li>
<li>&nbsp;Sam Palladio&rsquo;s falsetto during <em>If I Didn&rsquo;t Know Better</em> just made my nipples hard (CR)</li>
<li>&nbsp;It took the final song in <em>Glee</em>&rsquo;s pilot (Journey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop Believing&rdquo;) to save the show. The final song in Nashville (an original) is just icing on the cake. (CR)</li>
<li>If this show ends up going off a cliff, it better be just like Khouri&rsquo;s own <em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em></li>
</ul>
