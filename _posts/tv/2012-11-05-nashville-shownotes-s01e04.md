<p><em><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Cast and Crew of Nashville,</strong> S1E04 &ndash; &ldquo;We Live in Two Different Worlds&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p><em>Episode synopsis:</em><br />The arrival of a woman from Teddy&#8217;s past tests his marriage; Rayna and Deacon perform at Teddy&#8217;s fundraiser; Juliette appears on &#8220;Good Morning America;&#8221; and Gunnar connects with his publisher&#8217;s assistant.</p>
<p><em>Original air date:</em><br />October 31, 2012</p>
<p><em>Shownotes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Oh-no-you-di-in&rsquo;t just hook-up, Rayna and Deacon! Oh, no, you didn&rsquo;t. (Dream sequence, false sass-alarm).</li>
<li>I want whatever cell phone camera was used to capture Juliette&rsquo;s shoplifting with such beautiful depth of field. And fake scan lines.</li>
<li>Diss! Scarlett skillfully dodged Gunner to land that celebratory record deal hug on Avery. </li>
<li>Rayan&rsquo;s sister is the &ldquo;mouth of the south&rdquo;? But she&rsquo;s not even a singer!</li>
<li>Apparently, Rayna&rsquo;s list of worse places to sing (in order): Airport. Mars. Hell. Connecticut. And THEN a country club?</li>
<li>Juliette on her knees in the back of a car is not as sexy as I had imagined.</li>
<li>Gunner&rsquo;s metaphor for his own sex-life is a kayak. What about the others? I say Rayna&rsquo;s a twin engine, Juliette&rsquo;s a whaler, and Lamar is definitely a Cleveland Steamer. </li>
<li>Teddy&rsquo;s ill-timed tick to scratch his neck is very telling he had an affair. And probably an STI. </li>
<li>Juliette&rsquo;s using her Twitter account. Remind me to cross-reference that I&rsquo;m writing to the right one.</li>
<li>Juliette just furiously emptied her mom&rsquo;s bag, and then emptied her heart. Okay, so the girl can act.</li>
<li>Charles Esten has visibly aged since his days as an improv comic. Whose lines are they, anyway? The ones on his face. They look good on him.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li>So new childhood trauma: Rayna&rsquo;s elementary school classmates made fun of her for liking country music. In Nashville. Uh huh. </li>
<li>Finally, a song! It only took &frac34; of the show to get to. Wasn&rsquo;t worth the wait. </li>
<li>Personalized guitar straps are like the punk rock of country music. You go, Deacon!</li>
<li>Where is this alt-rock &ldquo;Ammunition&rdquo; song coming from?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Closing comments</em>: I needed a cold shower after this episode. Not because it starts off with a sexual fantasy and ends with a one-night stand, but because it was so damn soapy. With all these scandals and heartaches brewing, it could spell the beginning of the show&rsquo;s <em>Glee</em>-ful demise if they can&rsquo;t harness these inspirations into a country music goldmine.</p>
