<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong><em>Dear Cast and Crew of Nashville,</em></strong><em> S1E05 &ndash; &ldquo;Move It on Over&rdquo;</em></span></p>
<p><em>Episode synopsis:</em><br />Rayna thinks about moving on when Deacon sets boundaries on their relationship; tension between Gunnar and Avery puts pressure on Scarlett; and as Juliette struggles with her mother&#8217;s addictions, Deacon is reminded of difficult moments in his past.</p>
<p><em>Original air date:</em><br />November 7, 2012</p>
<p><em>Shownotes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Starting with a song. This episode is better already. </li>
<li>Rayna won&rsquo;t release a greatest hits album until she&rsquo;s 70? Sounds about right, since her view of the music industry is stuck in the 70s as well. </li>
<li>So Teddy&rsquo;s big secret with Peggy is embezzlement, not embeddingment? </li>
<li>90s music video alert: Silk sheets floating on a sound stage!</li>
<li>Scarlett and Gunner are performing a song for Lady Antebellum&rsquo;s management. Are they setting up the first country cameo (and suggesting Lady Antebellum don&rsquo;t write their own songs)?</li>
<li>I guess Juliette moved. She used to drive to her own front gate, now gawkers are watching her family drama spill out the front door and into the street. </li>
<li>Avery just turned himself on by offering to play guitar. Creepy.</li>
<li>To see what a constipated middle-aged man looks like, observe Rayna&rsquo;s manager&rsquo;s face when Rayna says she&rsquo;ll try writing her own songs.</li>
<li>Deacon swoops in to send Juliette&rsquo;s mom to rehab. Patent pending on this reality show: &ldquo;Celebrity Intervention! Your favourtie star, telling you to shape the fuck up!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Once again, a song by Scarlett and Gunner steals the show. Oh, wait. Avery just stole their show with a guitar solo. Such beautiful tension coming out of that steal guitar&hellip;</li>
<li>Props to the casting director for finding an actress (Sylvia Jefferies) who actually looks like an addict to play Juliette&rsquo;s mom. </li>
<li>Juliette just got bitch slapped &ndash; but not for being a bitch, for once. </li>
<li>Oh, now Juliette&rsquo;s really moving houses. Again?&#8230;</li>
<li>Like a classy comedian, Deacon knows how to handle a heckler with grace.</li>
<li>Wait, now Deacon knocks out the heckler, after the show, when the guy apologizes? I&rsquo;m confused.</li>
<li>Wow. Rayna just set a new standard in rejection. Not accepting someone&rsquo;s (Deacon&rsquo;s) one collect-phone call from prison. </li>
<li>&ldquo;How complicated&rdquo; does Gunner want to make his relationship with Hailey? Sex in the office complicated. </li>
<li>After the diss of the decade, Deacon let&rsquo;s Rayna sellout their song to a makeup company? I guess he&rsquo;s waiting until the commercial airs before punching her out, too.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Closing comments</em>: Restraint is apparently the ultimate revenge in this evening soap opera. Or at least withholding retribution until it feels less predictable. It&rsquo;s a good tactic, and the abundance of songs this episode was a welcome return after last week. Refraining from celebrity cameos proves the show is clearly not aiming to be the <em>Entourage</em> of country music, and may just reference the genre&rsquo;s biggest (retired) stars in an attempt to forge their own new ones.&nbsp;</p>
