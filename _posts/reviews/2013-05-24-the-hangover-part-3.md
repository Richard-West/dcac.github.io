<p><em><span style="font-size:120%;"><strong>Dear Bryant Powell, </strong>Stand-In for Zach Galifiankis,&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p>Tell me the truth, Bryant. It&rsquo;s all a joke, isn&rsquo;t it? An expensive, elaborate inside joke. A hilarious showbiz prank. A 60-million dollar episode of <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/between_two_ferns">Between Two Ferns</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must know. You were on set with Zach with all the time. I mean, not <em>right beside</em> him or anything&mdash;but even in those brief moments while you were swapping places, after the marks were set and the lights were ready, something of his motivations must have been revealed. A knowing wink? A clandestine nod? Some sort of dismissive wanking motion?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the magic of Galifianakis&rsquo; act: one never quite knows whether the joke is <em>for</em> you or if it&rsquo;s <em>on</em> you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a problem, Bryant, because <em>The</em> <em>Hangover Part 3</em> belongs entirely to Galifiankis and Ken Jeong. The rest of the cast seems to be fulfilling their contractual obligations&mdash;and who can blame them? Bradley Cooper has shrugged off the endearing douchebaggery that launched his career (in <em>Wedding Crashers</em> and the original <em>Hangover</em>) in favor of embracing his new status as doe-eyed, Oscar-nominated leading man. Ed Helms seems content to explore more complex versions of his nebbish dentist character in flicks like <em>Cedar Rapids</em> and <em>Jeff Who Lives At Home</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>While the first two <em>Hangover </em>films relied heavily on a somewhat unique dramatic structure (we never saw the balls-tripping bender that incited the action, only the aftermath), this last chapter, to its detriment, breaks from the formula. Instead we get John Goodman as a Vegas crime boss who kidnaps unlucky Doug (Justin Bartha&rsquo;s absence is at least consistent) to compel the rest of the Wolf Pack to find and capture master criminal Chow (Jeong). Which they do, eventually, in a series of complicated set-pieces that never really seem to go anywhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first Hangover suffered a bit from the same kind of scene-to-scene lack of payoff, but it nonetheless felt a bit special, a bit distinct; Galifiankis, in particular, who brought such an unsettling, endearing weirdness to his character, like he had something to prove to mainstream audiences about what to expect from the funny man in a comedy ensemble.</p>
<p>But the third time around it all feels a bit tired. And I get the impression that Galifianakis knows it. Which is why you have to tell me, Bryant: is that palpable sense of lethargy and laziness, of going through the motions&mdash;is it some sort of clever meta-commentary on the Hollywood recycling system?</p>
<p>Does Zach Galifianakis know how lame <em>The Hangover Part 3</em> is? And is he making it lame on purpose?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jared Young</p>
