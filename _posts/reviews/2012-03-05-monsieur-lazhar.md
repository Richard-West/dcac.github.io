<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><em><strong>Dear Laurent Boye, </strong>International Publicist,</em></span></p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s been busy the past few months! Let me start by congratulating you on the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nomination for <em>Monsieur Lazar</em>. Getting the Academy to sit through another Canadian film about isolation and depression could not have been easy. Sure, there&rsquo;s no weird sex or snowshoes, but opening with a teacher hanging herself in a classroom? You were probably tempted to lock the exits. Lucky for you, the story subverts expectations and turns into a genuine crowd pleaser within about five minutes. At that point, the film does a pretty good job of selling itself.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s go back to when you first heard writer and director Philippe Falardeau was turning a one-man play into a feature film. I imagine everyone at Telefilm was reaching for red markers. Theatre icon Daniel McIvor adapted his own solo stage effort but didn&rsquo;t exactly bring down the <em>House</em>. International sensation Robert Lepage tried, but is now in self-imposed cinematic exile from <em>The Far Side of the Moon</em>. Even by Canadian standards, the initial odds of success were stacked pretty heavy against Falardeau.</p>
<p>His last feature, <em>It&rsquo;s Not Me I Swear!,</em> certainly proved how emotionally effective he could make an eccentric visual pallet and melancholy characters. But although you can now promote him as one of Canada&rsquo;s most dependable directors, no one gets a financing carte blanche in our subsidized industry (contrary to what your detractors on Sun TV have said). So at what point did you know you might have a critical and commercial hit on your hands?</p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/5005f6bcc4aa41161b33e89e/5329cf1fe4b07c068ebf74de/5329cf20e4b07c068ebf7c15/1336797904039/lazhar-2.jpg" alt="" /></span></span></p>
<p>Casting Fellag as the titular star was probably a good start. The Algerian actor is apparently famous in his homeland as a comedian, but I would have never guessed. His dramatic performance is subtle, layered and enchanting in a way our native gag specialists (Jim Carrey, Mike Myers, Patrick Huard, etc.) always fall short when crossing genres. I know playing against type makes your job a nightmare, but in this case, the North American public&rsquo;s unfamiliarity only helped the character&rsquo;s authenticity. But please tell him that around here, only rock stars and wrestlers get to go by one name.</p>
<p>I am confused, however, why you abandoned the Canadian poster, featuring the teacher walking alone down a hallway with a &ldquo;papier poisson&rdquo; taped to his back. It was such a simple and poetic moment from the film that captured the essence of his struggle to fit into his foreign home. Americans love fish-out-of-water stories too, yet the smiling family portrait with his students, when taken out of context, has far less dramatic and thematic relevance. I also struggle to understand how it helps the film commercially. But at least you stuck with a French title. Calling the film Mr. Lazhar would have robbed the story of some French post-colonial undertones, and just plain sounded banal. Kind of like why perfume companies don&rsquo;t translate &ldquo;eau de toilette.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/5005f6bcc4aa41161b33e89e/5329cf1fe4b07c068ebf74de/5329cf20e4b07c068ebf7c16/1336797924667/lazhar-3.jpg" alt="" /></span></span></p>
<p>The young actors, however, did deserve more prominence in the publicity I suppose. &Eacute;milien N&eacute;ron, as the troubled Simon, absolutely nails his climactic scene that is a lynch pin for the whole story. Each of the other student performances also feel refreshingly age appropriate and honest. So while I&rsquo;m able to appreciate their importance after the fact, I think the film&rsquo;s success in Canada proves the right poster can help the film appeal to a wider demographic than <em>Half Nelson</em>, or even <em>Dead Poets Society</em>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now seen the film twice with vastly different audiences. First with critics at a steely press and industry screening during the Toronto International Film Festival, and again months later with patriotic cheerleaders at one of Heritage Minister James Moore&rsquo;s swanky Parliament Hill movie nights. In both cases, my own sample exit polls found people agreed the film was more moving <em>because</em> of the director&rsquo;s resistance to sentimentality.  The American poster does just the opposite, but I suppose getting the Yanks to swallow a French Canadian pill requires a lot of sugar.  So here&rsquo;s hoping you find continued success south of the border.</p>
<p>With glowing hearts,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
