<p><em><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Roger Tonry,</strong> Aerial Consultant,</span></em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so confused. So, so confused. I just&hellip; I can&rsquo;t even&hellip; wow. I mean most people in the film industry have a few strange credits. Early gigs to pay the bills or gain experience are like a rite of passage. But your entire IMDb filmography is just&hellip; awesome. Editor on <em>Playboy: Wet &amp; Wild</em>. Cinematographer on <em>Playboy: Sexy </em><em>Lingerie</em><em> II</em>. Director of <em>Playboy: The Best of Pamela Anderson</em>.&nbsp; Sure, it&rsquo;s a little &ldquo;specialized&rdquo;, but so what? You&rsquo;re living the manly man&rsquo;s dream. But now this: <em>Planes</em>. In the world of <em>Cars</em>. From the creators of toys, and lunch boxes, and more plastic than even Pamela Anderson can tolerate. Dude, it&rsquo;s safe to say that this big-budget Disney film qualifies as the artistic low-point of your career.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being serious.</p>
<p>I understand that this is a movie for kids. Young kids. Anyone over the age of 8 is probably going to feel like they&rsquo;re being talked down to. But come on. You know better than anyone that attracting adults matters. An intelligent joke here and there, a clever plot twist &ndash; anything to raise this unapologetically exploitive picture into something not so embarrassing. That&rsquo;s the whole <em>Playboy</em> mantra. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not what you were hired for. Which is even more confusing.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way you obviously learned something about aerial photography. Makes sense &ndash; there&rsquo;s only so many ways to shoot naked centerfolds before you need to get really creative.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;m happy to report that the aerial perspectives in <em>Planes</em> are actually my favourite part of the film. Weeee! In some of the training sequences for this (painfully uninspired) race-around-the-world underdog story, the point-of-view holds long enough to feel like we&rsquo;re really following those exaggerated curves of a mountain or soft contours of a hill.</p>
<p>Hmm. I wonder where the inspiration for that came from.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just not much else here to enjoy. A few plane puns made me smirk, but never resulting in anything as drastic as a smile. And I have a kid now, I should be open to this stuff. But the advance screening of <em><a href="/letters/2013/8/9/elysium.html">Elysium</a></em> was playing in the room right next door, dammit. I felt the way Ricky Martin must have during all his video shoots, surrounded by women from your films: sure, I&rsquo;ll do it because it&rsquo;s my job, but I feel sad inside. It&rsquo;s just not my thing. Why can&rsquo;t I be surrounded by <em>those</em> people? My people. People like you.</p>
<p>Let me know when your career gets back on track. Those are films I actually want to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
