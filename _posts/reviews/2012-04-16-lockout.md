excerpt: "You&rsquo;re already getting the gears from the online Nerderati about how much your new film <em>Lockout</em> &ndash; as of the mailing of this letter, still unreleased &ndash; owes to John Carpenter&rsquo;s sci-fi cult classic <em>Escape From New York.</em> And they&rsquo;re not wrong: the super-max prison (yours is on a space station), the first-family hostage (you&rsquo;ve swapped the salt-and-pepper President for his comely daughter, played here by Maggie Grace), the squinty, thuggish, quick-witted super-soldier (you traded young Kurt Russell for not-so-young Guy Pearce), and an escape-pod-load of other Easter-eggs I surely missed."

<p>You&rsquo;re already getting the gears from the online Nerderati about how much your new film <em>Lockout</em> &ndash; as of the mailing of this letter, still unreleased &ndash; owes to John Carpenter&rsquo;s sci-fi cult classic <em>Escape From New York.</em> And they&rsquo;re not wrong: the super-max prison (yours is on a space station), the first-family hostage (you&rsquo;ve swapped the salt-and-pepper President for his comely daughter, played here by Maggie Grace), the squinty, thuggish, quick-witted super-soldier (you traded young Kurt Russell for not-so-young Guy Pearce), and an escape-pod-load of other Easter-eggs I surely missed.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot more going on here than a slavish ripping-off of everyone&rsquo;s favourite post-apocalyptic action-comedy, isn&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s not call it a rip-off, because that implies an act of theft. Shakespeare borrowed liberally from Plutarch&rsquo;s <em>Parallel Lives</em> to conjure rich historical details in plays like <em>Antony &amp; Cleopatra</em>, and, as in his work, which enriched and contextualized existing tropes, all the appropriation here is above board. In fact, it seems to be the whole point. So let&rsquo;s call <em>Lockout</em> what it is: a tribute.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just <em>Escape</em> that you&rsquo;re borrowing from; and it&rsquo;s not just a genre, or style, or era. It&rsquo;s&hellip;well, <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>There are direct allusion to <em>Aliens</em> and <em>Die Hard</em>, minor tics and twitches adopted from <em>The Road Warrior</em> and <em>Minority Report</em>, a denouement that unfolds like a parody of <em>The Usual Suspects</em>, and even a weirdly misplaced impression of Dustin Hoffman in <em>Rain Main</em>. On paper, at least, you created the ultimate mash-up flick.</p>
<p><em>Lockout</em>, then, should be a cinema geek&rsquo;s nirvana. But the whole is slightly less than the sum of its parts.  It doesn&rsquo;t &ndash; it <em>can&rsquo;t</em>, really &ndash; live up to the high standard set by all those other films. That&rsquo;s the danger of riffing, in the Shakespearian manner, off past masterpieces: sometimes, in the remixing, what made them great is lost.</p>
<p>Anyways, what I wanted to tell you, Luc, is that I appreciated the effort.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jared Young</p>
<p>PS.  I think you and I both know that the real reason to sit through these 90 minutes is for Guy Pearce. His Snake McClane (or John Plissken&mdash;tomato, to<em>mah</em>-to) is able to make more of your often blocky dialogue than poor Maggie Grace, who spends half the flick looking like Tetsuo from <em>Akira</em>. He&rsquo;s a worthy heir to Russell, and his performance is the closest <em>Lockout</em> ever gets to playing on the same field as its source material.</p>
