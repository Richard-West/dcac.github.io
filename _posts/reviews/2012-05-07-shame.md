<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><em><strong>Dear Michael Fassbender&rsquo;s Penis,</strong> Actor,</em></span></p>
<p>Everyone is talking about you. As the breakout star of Steve McQueen&rsquo;s ode to impassive sex and emotional vacancy, there&rsquo;s no denying that you have a commanding screen presence. It was hard to take my eyes off you&mdash;yet I think your contributions to the film are being overlooked. Indeed, it&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re out of frame that you do your best work.</p>
<p>You play the very busy penis of Brandon (Michael Fassbender), a handsome single fellow of undefined professional orientation who lives out a teenage male fantasy in his barren New York bachelor-pad: sex with prostitutes, sex with socialites beneath the New Jersey turnpike, sex with himself in front of his laptop. When Brandon&rsquo;s sister (Carey Mulligan) shows up to spend a few nights on the couch, and, in a drunken fit, beds one of his colleagues, it&rsquo;s your jealous twitching that drives him to seek solace in ever more dangerous &ndash; and wanton &ndash; sexual scenarios. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But the truth is, while you&rsquo;re clearly working hard throughout, it&rsquo;s the one scene in which you&rsquo;re <em>not</em> working that best exemplifies McQueen&rsquo;s diagnostic treatment of Brandon&rsquo;s peculiar fetish (which, really, is a broad, all-encompassing fetish for everything dispassionate and mechanical). The moment most difficult to watch isn&rsquo;t when Brandon has you dipping in and out of two prostitutes, or even when, desperate for release, he takes you into the back room of a gay night club&mdash;it&rsquo;s when, seemingly on the precipice of finding himself in a real human relationship, your disinterest sabotages the affair. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Though it&rsquo;s full of sex, <em>Shame</em> is by no means a sexy film. Even the scene you share with Carey Mullligan&rsquo;s vagina (in which, unseen, you are nonetheless a threatening offscreen presence) has a medical coldness to it. Which is the point, I suppose. To be titillated by Brandon&rsquo;s exploits would be contradictory; he, himself, isn&rsquo;t titillated by them. Only, perhaps, by the <em>idea</em> of them.</p>
<p>Clearly you and Mr. Fassbender work well together. The scenes you share (in the shower, in the bathroom stall at his workplace) suggest an intimacy long in the making. I hope to see you collaborating again sometime soon. Maybe the next <em>X-Men</em> movie? Surely Magneto, in those burgundy tights, surrounded by teenage runaways, has a few psychosexual issues that need to be explored.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enviously,</p>
<p>Jared Young</p>
