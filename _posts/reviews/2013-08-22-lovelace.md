<p><em>Hey, watch the teeth! </em></p><p>That&rsquo;s a phrase nobody involved in a porno ever wants to hear&mdash;even back in the 70s. Same thing applies to a film that&rsquo;s <em>about </em>making porn in the &lsquo;70s. It just ruins the magic. Kills the vibe. Makes the whole thing feel forced. Frankly, if someone has to say it: you&rsquo;re doing a sloppy job.</p><p>The good news is, I never once noticed your teeth. You performed like a pro. Just like Linda Lovelace in the X-rated blockbuster <em>Deep Throat</em>. Which also worries me&mdash; were you horrifically taken advantage of, too?</p><p>Hey, it&rsquo;s possible. With so many stars on set, who&rsquo;s to say you weren&rsquo;t pressured to do a few favours on the side? Maybe a courtesy polish for Amanda Seyfried, who was probably looking for any excuse to smile after recreating the abuse and rape that her character endured in real-life? Maybe James Franco needed some help scraping the residual plaque from his <em>Spring Breakers</em> grill to portray Hugh Hefner? Maybe Peter Sarsgaard begged for a total orthodontic reconstruction so he&rsquo;d never have to portray another snaggle-toothed creep ever again? The stories you must have! I can hardly wait for your inevitable tell-all book that reveals everything that went on behind the scenes of <em>Lovelace</em>.</p><p>I expect you&rsquo;ll take the lead of co-directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman by telling us the whole tale the way we <em>expect</em> it happened. It will be an artistic rendition, with straightforward but pleasing cinematography, well-designed period details and comfortable pacing that allows the characters to feel like the flesh-and-blood counterparts they&rsquo;re portraying. The first half of the story will only hint at the mistreatment. Then, at the midway point, we can go back to fill in the gaps and see how glossed-over the first story really was.</p><p>This is the most fascinating aspect of <em>Lovelace</em>. But the problem is, like a set of dentures, no matter how accurate the molds and fittings they&rsquo;re still artificial. The film never acknowledges Lovelace&rsquo;s tendency to contradict her own statements, her pendulous back-and-forth swing in and out of the feminist movement, and it certainly fails to mention her involvement in the bestiality film <em>Dogarama</em> that preceded <em>Deep Throat</em> (I guess there are some cavities best left unfilled).</p><p>So get to work. If <em>Deep Throat</em> could make $600M dollars, I&rsquo;m sure you can cash in on the public&rsquo;s oral fixation too.</p><p>Keep your chin up,</p><p>Christopher</p>
