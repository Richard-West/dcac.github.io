<p><em style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Sarah Sprawls</strong>, Set Decorator</em></p>
<p>Every movie asks us to believe in a unique little world. Some movies do it by grabbing you by the lapels and driving its proverbial forehead through yours. Others just sit in the corner, crying, and guilting you into asking &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; <em>For a Good Time, Call&hellip; </em>dumps a bunch of brightly colored Skittles in your hands, cranks the tunes, gives you a smirk, slaps your ass, and hollers, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go ride ponies!&rdquo; And lo, I <em>did</em> believe.</p>
<p>Your job is to help make this happen. Every little visual detail on set needs to contribute&mdash;anything out of place can hinder our belief. It&rsquo;s your job to smooth them out, make these little filmmaking necessities go unnoticed. Sounds bad, I know, but I was looking for faults. I almost couldn&rsquo;t believe that a movie this slight could carry me along so easily.</p>
<p>The plot is very straightforward. College acquaintances Lauren (Lauren Miller) and Katie (Ari Graynor) share an unfortunate incident that causes them to instantly dislike each other.&nbsp; The harsh financial realities of living in NYC motivate them to swallow their pride and move into together. This allows them to make ends meet and to start to become friends.</p>
<p>Further job troubles occur, one thing leads to another, and the two start a phone sex business together. Hilarity ensues, friendships are built, troubles arise, and all are overcome. The movie itself seems to constantly paper over the conflicts, as if they were obligations that simply need to be fulfilled. It is always eager to get back to the colors and kinetics that are the real stars of the show.</p>
<p>Miller and Graynor are a treat to watch. They float from scene to scene and dart between plot points, never getting weighed down by drama and never letting the unseemly subject matter seem smutty or base. Seth Rogen&rsquo;s cameo, of course, being the exception &ndash; he alone slows the pace down just enough to make it all seem <em>gross</em>. The others are having fun all the way through, and so was I.</p>
<p>Besides you, Sarah, I credit director Jamie Travis for giving this movie such a clear and unique tone. Another indie-turned-studio director might insist on the v&eacute;rit&eacute; or gritty angle to the story. Instead, Travis headed in the opposite direction, taking the strengths of the set-up as far as they would go, wrapping them in those bright candy colors and happy smiles.</p>
<p>Wow, listen to me. I was surprised and not the least bit disappointed. I sat down and watched a movie that was fun and light, but without any of the shortcuts or sad societal clich&eacute;s that make me want to tear my hair out.</p>
<p>Call me anytime.</p>
