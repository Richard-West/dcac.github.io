<p>Do you have the time, to listen to me whine<br />About the way this film&rsquo;s stuck in &rsquo;99?<br />Pie is one those, melodramatic sequels<br />Neurotic with a tone of doubt about it.</p>
<p>Sometimes I give them a free pass<br />Sometimes my mind enjoys this crap<br />But the films are adding up<br />What&rsquo;s next, three girls and a cup?<br />Am I just paranoid<br />or is this old?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to the show<br />To see how far they&rsquo;d go<br />There&rsquo;s not a lack of sex<br />Or skin to go &lsquo;round.<br />Jim sure looked sore<br />When squishing his junk for<br />A trick that Judd Apatow<br />Wishes he&rsquo;d known.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to give up on this cast<br />It&rsquo;s time to let the past be past<br />These stars are all washed up<br />But the crowds keep showing up<br />This franchise should be done<br />But it goes on.</p>
<p>Grasping for greenbacks<br />It&rsquo;s a modest comeback.&nbsp;</p>
