<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><strong>Dear Paula Jack,</strong> Dialect Coach,</span></p>
<p>As a Canadian, I&rsquo;m always delighted to hear witty dialogue roll effortlessly off a British tongue. The polished and mannered delivery makes smart seem positively brilliant. I can tell you fussed over the finer points of Kristen Scott Thomas&rsquo;s uptight take on the cutthroat political class. I could hear it in Amr Wakes&rsquo; soft spoken Western-Arab sermons. It was there in Ewan McGregor&rsquo;s layman interpretation of scientific-speak. And Emily Blunt&rsquo;s pitch-perfect overall charm is just beyond reproach. Altogether, <em>Salmon Fishing in Yemen</em> is such a light and airy affair that the whole thing floats along on personality alone. Still, I hoped the story would at least try to swim against the current of a standard romantic comedy. The film unfortunately confuses exotic locations with originality, evidenced by the matter-of-fact title itself. Although I do admit, it all sounds more poetic in the Queen&rsquo;s English. Thanks to you.</p>
<p>Hearing You Loud and Clear,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
<p>P.S. I hope you saved your A-game for <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. That gig could prove to be the &lsquo;Bane&rsquo; of your existence.</p>
