<p>Sorry you weren&rsquo;t able to convince Denzel to get over Tony Scott. You did what you could, encouraging him to grow out his hair, brave a little grey&mdash;basically, to act his age. But it hardly makes a difference. Denzel still surrounds himself with epileptic cameramen and handsome whitebread co-stars., hoping to recreate that old <em>Man on Fire</em> magic.  <em>Safe House</em> is a perfectly passable action thriller, but, in the end, it&rsquo;s a shame your modest makeover didn&rsquo;t last. At least you got to ruffle through Ryan Reynolds&rsquo; dreamy locks.</p>
