<p>Given your line of work, gun violence must be a difficult reality for you. What was it like working on <em>Blackbird</em>, a film about a school shooting that never actually happens? Films like <em>Elephant </em>or <em>We Need To Talk About Kevin</em> want to show carnage and victims and death, but <em>Blackbird</em> means to discuss a larger picture about the subject: the bullying, the judgment, and the hysteria behind empty threats and passionate, ill-fated cries for help. These are things that writer/director Jason Buxton wants to talk about, and I&rsquo;m guessing you appreciate that.</p>
<p>Surely you&rsquo;ve heard of &ldquo;Chekhov&rsquo;s Gun&rdquo; - the idea that if you introduce a firearm in the opening act of a story, it must be fired later in the narrative. Otherwise, what would be the point of its existence? <em>Blackbird</em> doesn&rsquo;t truly deviate from this philosophy, as we see a rifle go off in the film&rsquo;s first act. You were no doubt there, behind the scenes, as the woefully-misunderstood Sean Randall (Connor Jessup) is on a hunting trip with his father. It was an important moment, as it shows Randall is uncomfortable with killing innocent life when given the opportunity to do so. He doesn&rsquo;t shoot the deer.</p>
<p>And yet, Sean is made out to be a psychopath in his small-town community. After a series of incidents with the douchebag hockey jocks at school &ndash; some of them involving death threats towards Sean &ndash; our protagonist becomes fed up, ranting to his only friend over instant messaging about how he&rsquo;d like to shoot them in retaliation. Naturally, these threats are shown to the proper authorities, and when combined with Sean&rsquo;s gothic appearance and dark taste in music, a judge sends him to straight to juvie.</p>
<p>Your safeguarding expertise was probably also beneficial at the correctional facility. There&rsquo;s a lot of fighting and violence there, too, as Sean becomes subjected to another kind of bullying. Thankfully, these scenes are handled with commendable control, excellent cinematography, and a surprising amount of reserve. It must have been amazing to watch Buxton, a first-time feature filmmaker, shoot with such dominance.</p>
<p>Because there aren&rsquo;t many guns in <em>Blackbird</em>, your job as weapons master was probably over and through fairly quickly. But don&rsquo;t think your work isn&rsquo;t appreciated! This is part of the film&rsquo;s strength. <em>Blackbird </em>is a refreshing take on the school shooting subject, because we find resolve through talking things through with patient determination. We know the truth will soon fly free, and Jessup&rsquo;s performance is strong enough to carry the entire film on his shoulders&hellip;even if his character gets a little stale here and there.</p>
<p>I must admit that what you do is impressive. Your job requires a fair amount of restraint &ndash; the film industry is obsessed with guns and weapons, and you probably feel like a babysitter most of the time. You keep the dangerous toys under your watch at all times. I feel like too many people disrespect the proper safety guidelines when it comes to owning a gun, which is why I applaud individuals like you.</p>
<p>Some call you a wrangler - but I call you a hero.</p>
<p>Yours in safety,</p>
<p>Jake</p>
