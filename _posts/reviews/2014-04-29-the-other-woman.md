<p>It&rsquo;s nice seeing more of you these days.&nbsp; You started acting way back in the 1990s, but recently &ndash; as a middle-aged woman &ndash; you&rsquo;ve really made an impression onscreen. In a series of comedies that explore modern mid-life crises and relationship challenges like <em>Knocked Up</em>, <em>17 Again</em>, <em>This is 40</em>, and now Nick Cassavetes&rsquo; <em>The Other Woman</em>, you&rsquo;ve established yourself as a fine comedian.</p>
<p>In <em>The Other Woman</em> you play Kate, a cuckolded housewife who finds out that her husband, played by Nikolaj&nbsp;Coster-Waldau, is cheating on her with not one but two other women, impersonated by Cameron Diaz and Kate Upton.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kate contacts the mistresses for details on her husband&rsquo;s philandering to discover that they ignored that he was married and feel cheated by him too.&nbsp; The three women decide to join forces to seek revenge.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a classic screwball scenario with two mistresses and a wife conspiring to bring down a scumbag husband. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The story is partially about female solidarity &ndash; instead of enemies, wife and mistresses become friends.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s far from feminist &ndash; female conversation in this movie revolves around one central thing: men.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the film&rsquo;s leads are three hot women who wear mini-skirts and bikinis throughout the picture.&nbsp; Not exactly shattering Hollywood female stereotypes, if you know what I&rsquo;m saying. &nbsp;Cassavetes banked on those close-ups of Kate Upton&rsquo;s walloping boobs and tight butt, I guarantee you that. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you and Diaz make a strong comedic duo. You&rsquo;re laugh-out-loud funny.&nbsp; And Kate Upton is charming.&nbsp; Along with <a title="Nicki Minaj" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicki_Minaj"><span style="color:windowtext;">Nicki Minaj</span></a>, Don Johnson, and the rest of the cast, a nice team was assembled to render this lighthearted and unpretentious comedy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My special compliments go out to you, Leslie.&nbsp; Your character was a weak housewife on paper, but you made her strong and hilarious onscreen.&nbsp; This movie could have gone way wrong, but you helped steer it right. Nice job.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Katherine</p>
