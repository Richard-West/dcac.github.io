<p><em style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Luuk Schmitz,</strong> Focus Puller, </em><br /> <br /> You&rsquo;re obviously a sharp guy. If you hadn&rsquo;t done your job right, this film would have been a complete blur. Playing with depth of field is a classic production trick used to manipulate audiences and it&rsquo;s definitely a personal favorite (as you can see in <a href="http://firstkissfilms.com/index2.php#!/{_home_}">my films</a>). Done right, the technique lures the viewer&rsquo;s eyes and helps set the mood. For a film created within the dying-too-young-of-cancer genre, we&rsquo;d expect that mood to be a sad one, yes, but also life-affirming. Except that would just be playing into a bad clich&eacute;, right? Heck, <span class="itemprop">Shailene Woodley&rsquo;s</span> character, Hazel, addresses that exact issue in the opening scene. &nbsp;She promises that this tear-jerker would not be sugar-coated. But then you come along with your beautiful soft-focus and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">bokeh</a> effects, and betray the promising set-up of seeing something that feels <em>real</em>.<br /> <br /> In terms of visuals, <em>The Fault in Our Stars </em>clearly<em> </em>doesn&rsquo;t take any risks. The camera techniques all fit squarely within the classic melodrama genre. The story is told mostly though use of close-ups, superfluous dolly shots and near undetectable zooms to build intensity and intimacy. Blurry edges help indicate when we are experiencing a past event and the rolling of focus (well done, by the way) when Hazel emerges from a coma creates an effective character&rsquo;s perspective. These are conventions because they work, after all, but they&rsquo;re also the very definition of sugar-coating a story.<br /> <br /> Optics aside, you certainly had a lovely lead to focus on. Despite being terminally ill, Hazel is very easy on the eyes; a natural beauty seemingly without the aid of a hair and makeup team. Her effortless look helped capture a truth to her character&rsquo;s experience and allowed for a believable wisdom that matched her soulful eyes. Ansel Elgort, playing Hazel&rsquo;s (boy)friend Gus, is equally well cast. He&rsquo;s charming, warm, and seemingly full of life. When tragedy strikes, the pain and sorrow Hazel and Gus express on screen actually felt genuine. Their performances of two terminally-ill love-struck teens was killing me! <br /> <br /> My new perspective as a mom meant I really had a hard time handling that part. And I wasn&rsquo;t the only one, based on all the sobbing I heard in the theater. For the first time, I found myself identifying with the paternal characters, specifically Hazel&rsquo;s mother (played lovingly by Laura Dern). So yes, I could have easily become swept up in the tragedy. But I found myself at an emotional distance. In part, maybe because this was my first film review for Dear Cast and Crew, so I was relieved to be wearing my &ldquo;film critic&rsquo;s hat&rdquo;. But your tricks also kept pulling me out of the story, which is the exact opposite of what they&rsquo;re supposed to do. <br /> <br /> <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> purports to be &#8220;telling the truth&#8221; about love, yet keeps resorting to the same gimmicks that make romantic films feel so manipulative. You did what you were asked, Luuk, but you did it a little too well.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Bridget Redmond<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Status: Air Mail (3.5/5)</em></strong></p></div>
