<p><em><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Bruce Hamme,</strong> Dolly Grip,</span></em></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s skip the pleasantries. I want to talk about a single shot in <em>Prisoners</em>: the dolly movement towards the tree. Remember? It&rsquo;s in the first 15 minutes of the film. You must have been thinking, what&rsquo;s the point of this shot? Nothing happens, we&rsquo;re just moving in on a tree. But then the disconcerting score comes in. And the colour is graded to perfection. And a story slowly unfolds around it. And a simple transition shot becomes just as powerful, tense, and unforgettable as the rest of the film.</p>
<p>Frankly, a shot like is only effective because, to Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, every detail matters. There is nothing superfluous or haphazard in his carefully curated universe. He&rsquo;s proven it in each of his feature films, from <em>Un 32 ao&ucirc;t sur terre</em>, to <em>Maelstr&ouml;m</em>, to <em>Polytechnique</em>, to <em>Incendies</em>.&nbsp; Now, in his Hollywood debut, he has taken a story that sounds like a formulaic movie-of-the-week drama &ndash; the search for two missing girls &ndash; and turned it into a first-rate emotional thriller.</p>
<p>With plenty of help, granted, from you and your boss, 10-time Oscar nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins (recent winner of <a href="/letters/2012/12/21/2012-silver-stamps.html">The Roger Deakins Award for Excellence in Being Roger Deakins</a>).</p>
<p>The cast also deserves credit. Hugh Jackman plays one of the missing girls&rsquo; fathers, alongside Terrence Howard, and, in the course of the film, comes to feel rather strongly that the lead detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) is not doing his job. In most director&rsquo;s hands, Jackman&rsquo;s character would dominate the story and be shot in the <a href="/letters/2013/6/19/world-war-z.html">frenetic shaky cam-style</a> with which Paul Greengrass has almost ruined Hollywood pictures. But Villeneuve knows better. He understands how restraint builds energy. His reveals are slow and steady.</p>
<p>And the deeper we push into the story, the more it becomes a morality tale.There&rsquo;s a puzzle motif within the film, but the emotional through-line is very straight&mdash;and even more powerful than the mystery. The characters go off the rails, but the storytelling never falters.</p>
<p>Bruce, you&rsquo;ve all made a picture that&rsquo;s as moving as, well, a dolly shot. It&rsquo;s smooth, beautiful, haunting and locked into its tracks &ndash; completely confident about where&rsquo;s it going. I enjoyed the ride so much (even at a run time of two and a half hours) that I was almost sad to see things finally resolve. But luckily, not at all unsatisfied.</p>
<p>On track,&nbsp;</p>
