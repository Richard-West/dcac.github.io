<p>That was a hell of a workout for you guys.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem fair. <em>After</em> <em>Earth</em> wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be your movie. It was supposed to be Jaden Smith&rsquo;s leading-lad coming out party, conceived, produced, and starring his leading-man dad, Will. But as soon as Jaden delivered his first lines as Kitai, a wannabe warrior living in a distant future, you must have realized how much his performance would rely on you.</p>
<p>Answer: a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that your co-stars didn&rsquo;t have the chance to prove themselves. In the interminably long opening monologue, Jaden&rsquo;s vocal chords do their best to explain what we (apparently) need to know: thousands of years ago humans were forced to leave Earth after ravaging the environment and leaving the planet uninhabitable; they found a pristine world dubbed Nova Prime where it was safe to rebuild civilization and thrive.</p>
<p>Or not. An alien race called the S&rsquo;krell have similar plans for Nova Prime, and a vicious war ensues in which they unleash upon humanity an army of warriors that are able to sense their prey&rsquo;s fear. Fortunately, superdad Cypher (Will Smith) is able to suppress his fear, becoming invisible to his enemies and something, something, something human victory is secured!</p>
<p>(Was it exhausting to read that? Just imagine how exhausting it is to watch.)</p>
<p>Jaden&rsquo;s poor larynx must have been pretty decimated after delivering all that exposition in the film&rsquo;s first ten minutes, because, for the rest of the film, you two are forced to be the outer space-Karate Kid&rsquo;s primary method of expressing emotion. The onus fell on you, the suborbital ridge, to do the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a lot of lifting. &nbsp;In the absence of help from any other limbs or organs, you heroically stepped up to convey young Kitai&rsquo;s inner turmoil. Lowering to demonstrated his disappointment at not passing his space-ranger exams; frowning to express frustration that his dad isn&rsquo;t as much a part of his life as he&rsquo;d like; arching to illustrate the joy of accompanying his father on a training mission; lifting high to communicate the horror he feels when that mission, of course, goes terribly wrong.</p>
<p>But you are only capable of so much. The <em>corrugator supercilii</em> muscle only moves in two directions, after all. Jaden Smith&rsquo;s crinkled brow achieves little more than expressing the general notion that he has feelings. You know, that look teenage boys use to convince girls that they&rsquo;re different than the other guys.</p>
<p>Or we could just blame <em>After Earth</em>&rsquo;s half-baked plotting for those shortcomings of emotion<em>.</em> With angry baboon rampages, giant bird attacks, and paralytic leech incursions, I don&rsquo;t blame Will Smith&rsquo;s face for retracting into a sour scowl and erasing every ounce of his natural charisma. Maybe it was a conscious choice. Maybe he wanted to place the focus on young Jaden. Sadly, however, the famed Smith charisma seems to be a recessive gene.</p>
<p>Still, I&rsquo;m glad you guys brought your A-game. No one else did.</p>
<p>Frowningly,</p>
