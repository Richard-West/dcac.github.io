<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re aware, but you were recently cast as a murderous reptile in a terrible film called <em>Runner Runner</em>.&nbsp; Frankly, I can&rsquo;t imagine you consented to appear in such a travesty. Leonardo DiCaprio, one of the film&rsquo;s producers and a renowned environmental activist, must have lured you into this slipshot production.&nbsp; Shame on him. On the bright side, your part was one of the best performances! When you slyly creep up on that chicken carcass floating in the water and then&#8230; crunch! Well done, Crocodile.&nbsp; If only the film&rsquo;s director, or its screenplay writers, or anyone, really, could have equally sank their teeth into the material.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m sure no one bothered to tell you, here&rsquo;s what your co-stars were up to in the film. Richie Furst (Justin Timberlake) is a poor Princeton student who struggles to make tuition.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s got nobody to fall back on since his father (John Heard) is a pitiful gambling addict.&nbsp; But the apple never falls far from the tree, and Furst tries to make ends meet by steering Princeton students to online gambling sites, exacting commission, and by gambling himself.&nbsp; He loses all of his money one night, but suspects he was cheated.&nbsp; So he decides to go find the head of the gambling site he played on, poker magnate Ivan Block (Ben Affleck), in tropical Costa Rica, to be compensated.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where you come in, Crocodile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the story moves to Costa Rica &ndash; which, as you know, was actually shot in Puerto Rico &ndash; Furst locates Block, makes an impression, and lands a job with the online gambling organization that cheated him. Furst then falls for Block&rsquo;s babe associate/girlfiend, Gemma Arterton, and they have a terribly unconvincing romance.&nbsp; The thing is, Crocodile, the film was so incredibly vacuous that nothing in it &lsquo;worked.&rsquo; Not even a carnal scene between two heartthrobs like Arterton and Timberlake; not even a crocodile scene with you. Nothing but crocodile tears all around.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t feel bad, Croc, Lawrence Olivier wouldn&rsquo;t have made a difference.&nbsp; Too many basic ingredients were missing in this wannabe suspense:&nbsp; a solid script, or a convincing villain, or, you know, suspense.</p>
<p>The film&rsquo;s director could have, at least, included you in those party scenes filled with boobage and booty.&nbsp; You could have run out of the water in a Jaws-busts-the-bikini-party sort of way, and wreaked havoc. Instead, you were given a role not fit for a reptile, unsuccessful in its attempt to inspire terror and suspense.&nbsp; Instead, we got Affleck playing a sore excuse for a villain. In one scene, his character pours a bucket of chicken fat on some Mafiosi&rsquo;s head, and then pushes him into the water where you&rsquo;re supposed to devour him. Except instead, you&#8230;&nbsp; well, I won&rsquo;t ruin it for those who, despite my warning against it, want to see the film.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that it was awkward, unconvincing and gross &ndash; because of the chicken fat, not you!&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Runner Runner, </em>as a whole, is a mess. It&rsquo;s too bad, because the online gambling thriller angle could have worked.&nbsp; After all, San Jos&eacute;, Costa Rica, is a real and renowned online gambler&rsquo;s paradise. Surely a little sociological research could have uncovered something interesting.&nbsp; And, as your cameo appearance portrayed, Crocodile, Costa Rica&rsquo;s a wildlife sanctuary.&nbsp; Those two aspects of the story could have substantiated the film.&nbsp; Alas, they didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But if you think you were represented poorly, you should hear Timberlake and Affleck&rsquo;s Spanish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lo siento,</p>
