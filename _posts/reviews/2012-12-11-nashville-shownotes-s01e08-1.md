<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong><em>Dear Cast and Crew of Nashville,</em></strong><em> S1E08 &ndash; &ldquo;Where Hew Leads Me&rdquo;</em></span></p>
<p><em>Episode synopsis:</em><br />Rayna examines her priorities after listening to Teddy explain his situation with Peggy. Elsewhere, Juliette enjoys the bond she&#8217;s forming with Sean&#8217;s family; Gunnar makes a confession to Scarlett; and Avery and Deacon get terrific career opportunities.</p>
<p><em>Original air date:</em><br />December 5, 2012</p>
<p><em>Shownotes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>So much for the afterglow of Rayna and Juliette&rsquo;s duet, eh Teddy?</li>
<li>Tell the props master that instead of programming &ldquo;Mom&rsquo;s Rehab&rdquo; in Juliette&rsquo;s phone, &ldquo;Make Annoyed Face and Hang Up&rdquo; would be perfectly clear.</li>
<li>What I would give to see Juliette <em>actually</em> chew out NFL Guy&rsquo;s parents for raising a boy who won&rsquo;t bone her without a ring.</li>
<li>Who did the location manager wrangle up to let you shoot around that acoustic guitar-shaped pool? My money is on Toby Keith.</li>
<li>That band just played the sober card (or chip) to rope in Deacon (or Chip)!</li>
<li>Hold on to that coffee filter Scarlett just got a phone number on. I have a feeling it will be worth a lot of drama soon.</li>
<li>Avery&rsquo;s rock star cred is apparently being suspended from catholic school for playing Black Sabbath. Someone&rsquo;s <em>Paranoid</em> about looking cool.</li>
<li>Coleman, showing Rayna some very lame scandal pictures: &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s not an affair, what it is?&rdquo; Gee I don&rsquo;t know, a hug?</li>
<li>White choirs just don&rsquo;t pack a punch, do they?</li>
<li>Excessive smiles, church performances &ndash; the lengths Juliette will go to just to get laid.</li>
<li>Apparently strumming the banjo on a porch can be sexy. Who knew! Thank you, Scarlett.</li>
<li>Gunner lands the kiss! But of course, being straight-forward always misfires in a soap opera. Even a good one like this.</li>
<li>Those huge pictures of Rayna&rsquo;s daughters in her room just reminded me that they&rsquo;ve been strangely absent for many episodes. I want an encore of their performance!</li>
<li>I guess I would hold a grudge too if I had to eat dry pancake mix as a kid and had my first kiss from one of my mom&rsquo;s boyfriends. Maybe even more pissed than Juliette (if that&rsquo;s possible).</li>
<li>Glad to see the hair department got the note that Rayna needs to look more uptight with all those ponytails she&rsquo;s getting this episode.</li>
<li>Look at all those candles Juliette put out hoping her man would put out!&nbsp; What? Don&rsquo;t tell me she&rsquo;s going to&hellip; dear God. The lady proposal. Juliette may officially only wear pants from now on. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Closing comments</em>: Lots of songs early kept the energy alive throughout this episode. Teddy might have been better off actually having an affair after Rayna&rsquo;s reaction to his (temporary?) embezzlement, but hopefully the attempted suicide by Peggy is as far as they take this scandal. Also, I refuse to refer to Juliette&rsquo;s potential fianc&eacute;e as anything other than &ldquo;NFL guy&rdquo; because there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;ll last on this show&hellip;</p>
