<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><em><strong>Dear Victoria St. Pierre, </strong>Moldmaker,</em></span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming, from your job title, that you make molds. Of faces, say. Or genitalia, perhaps. And from these molds (I&rsquo;m further assuming) came the prosthetics that contribute to two of the biggest surprises in <em>21 Jump Street</em>.   And this perfectly absurd reimagining of the 80s cop show turns out to be full of surprises. How well Channing Tatum&rsquo;s knucklehead charm translates into comedy; how cleverly the conceit of two narcotics cops going undercover at high school is both embraced and subverted; the unexpected affection it has for its source material.  But truly, that nose and that penis&mdash;excellent mold work, Victoria. The latter elicited the loudest laugh, and the former provided me the most genuine and pleasant shock I can remember having in a movie theatre.  I&rsquo;d congratulate you further, but I think the pleasure you had while making those molds was probably more rewarding that any praise I can give you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jared Young</p>
