<p><em><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Thunder Levin</strong>, Writer,</span></em></p>
<p>Take me back to the beginning, to that eureka moment when everything clicked. I can&rsquo;t imagine the euphoria you must have felt knowing your years of ripping off genre films had finally paid off with something <em>original</em>. No more mockbusters of <em>Pacific Rim</em>, <em>Battleship</em>, and zombies-versus-whatever. You must have known this was it&mdash;your ticket to the big leagues. You came up with a concept so bold that no major studio would dare touch it. A title so bankable, so compelling, that the script was irrelevant. This threat you invented out of thin air (<em>really</em> thin air) is so twisted that your tombstone will inevitably read: <em>Herein lies the man who gaveth the world its first</em> <em>sharknado</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, the <em>first</em>. Because there&rsquo;s bound to be a tsunami of sequels, spin-offs, and knock-offs.</p>
<p>Oh, the irony.</p>
<p>You may go on to more audacious projects, but it&rsquo;s doubtful any will be so incompetently made. The piss-poor special effects, the incoherent editing, the completely inconsistent treatment of locations and weather &ndash; unfortunately, these low-budget tropes aren&rsquo;t leveraged for laughs the way I expected. Instead, it feels like the hardworking men and women behind the scenes just weren&rsquo;t up to the challenge of bringing your ambitious vision to life.&nbsp; Yet somehow, your genius shines through.</p>
<p>Physics, biology and basic logic have never been so willingly victim to one man&rsquo;s brilliance. The characters accept sharks raining down from the sky, and frankly, so do we. Really, Thunder&mdash;enjoy this moment.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re bound to attract even bigger stars, but few will look as lost and pathetic as Tara Reid. Worse yet, few will give performances as sincere and irony-free as Ian Ziering&rsquo;s (he&rsquo;s really earning his paycheck in earnest). Even Cassie Scerbo&rsquo;s character &ndash; with her oh-so-tragic backstory that you may have, sort of, <em>kind of</em> borrowed from <em>Jaws</em> &ndash; is actually, you know, <em>decent</em>. Thank God you found such a novel way to bring her back from certain death. The film&rsquo;s most fun scene, bar none.</p>
<p>We live in an age of been there, seen that. Nothing&rsquo;s new anymore. How could anyone ever take the clich&eacute;-ridden shark-horror genre to new heights? Somehow, you did it. With your fame-ready name and freaky mind, everything just lined up for the perfect storm, didn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Sharkcerely,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
