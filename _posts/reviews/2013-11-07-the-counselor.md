<p>Sometimes, you just need to get the job done, right? I mean, that&rsquo;s the whole reason you&rsquo;re on set. Getting daily production reports, overseeing the cash flow, making sure stars come out of their trailers &ndash; you&rsquo;re the person who has to say, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how stupid this all seems, you agreed to make this fucking thing, so do it.&rdquo; And on a movie like <em>The Counselor</em>, you might be the only reason the film ever got finished.</p>
<p>But really, who can blame you for buying into a film so packed with potential?</p>
<p>First, you have Sir Ridley Scott at the helm. True, he hasn&rsquo;t directed a proper critical or commercial success in over a decade, but the man is a bona fide talent who can attract the best in the business. For this job, he lined up a parade of A-listers to tackle the material: Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz and some impressive supporting players. But the best part? They&rsquo;re working from an original screenplay Cormac McCarthy! No chance anything will be lost in translation from his novel for once, right? Start printing the money and Oscar ballots now.</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second. Clearly you, Scott and co. didn&rsquo;t learn anything from Oliver Stone&rsquo;s eerily <a href="/letters/2012/7/6/savages.html">similar venture</a>.</p>
<p>So once again, a star-studded cast is pitted against the savage drug trade along the U.S.-Mexican border. This time, the story focuses on an unnamed legal Counselor (Fassbender) who wants to finally make the big bucks by bankrolling a risky drug scheme (is this suddenly sounding a little close-to-home?). He&rsquo;s looped in by Bardem&rsquo;s thinly painted portrait of a wacky cheetah loving drug-lord and the man&rsquo;s sexy, nympho, cheetah-spot-tattooed girlfriend (Diaz). The Counselor keeps his own girlfriend (Cruz) blissfully in the dark about his exploits, and politely refuses to heed the warnings of Brad Pitt, playing a Brad Pitt-in-a-cowboy-hat drug-dealer type. It&rsquo;s a very straight-forward and ultimately, silly affair, capped off by a lot of decapitations and a pointlessly provocative car sex-scene (literally &ndash; sex with a car).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did I miss something? Was there ever supposed to be more to this standard cautionary drug tale than what we got? Maybe not, and maybe it&rsquo;s that safety in familiarity that got the film financed. But what a waste. Why not leverage your assets, take a gamble and try to actually surprise people?</p>
<p>I know, easy for me to say.</p>
<p>Bucking off,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
