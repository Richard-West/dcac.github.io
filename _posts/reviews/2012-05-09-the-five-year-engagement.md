<p><span style="color:black;">Poaching an egg is tricky business. Getting that perfect oval shape, the firm whites and thick-but-runny yolk</span>&mdash;<span style="color:black;">it takes practice. Lots of practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">Why do I mention this? Because, in the goofily charming introduction to our characters in </span><em>The Five-Year Engagement</em><span style="color:black;">, we meet Tom (Jason Segel) as he prepares a pair of perfectly poached eggs. This may be the first time I&#8217;ve ever seen food preparation used as character development. It&#8217;s immediately clear that this isn&#8217;t the standard man-child that populates much of producer Judd Apatow&#8217;s work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">No, Tom is an accomplished chef living and working in San Francisco, on the path to being head chef at a new it-restaurant. He&#8217;s also recently engaged to prospective psychology grad student Violet (Emily Blunt). In other words, his souffl</span><span style="color:black;">&eacute;</span><span style="color:black;"> is on the rise.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">This being a comedy, though, eggs </span><span style="color:black;">&ndash;</span><span style="color:black;"> and hearts </span><span style="color:black;">&ndash;</span><span style="color:black;"> are sure to break. Soon enough, Violet is accepted into a graduate program in Ann Arbor, Michigan, (apparently Hollywood&#8217;s version of hell). So Tom makes the bitter choice to follow his bride-to-be to her new school.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">Now that he&#8217;s given up his dream job as a head chef, it might seem like there&#8217;s no longer a place for you to practice your fine food stylings. But like I said earlier, character development. Whether it&#8217;s tasting wedding cakes, preparing venison Tom has hunted himself, or even avoiding the temptation of day-old donuts, food helps flavour Tom and Violet&#8217;s evolving relationship. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">And it all works. The ups, downs, and in-betweens of this protracted courtship are always involving and well-defined; often because of the food you have placed on screen. In fact, this film brings together two of what appear to be Segel&#8217;s obsessions: Muppets and food. What other writer would hinge a climactic scene on Cookie Monster and find a way to make it work? </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">Delicious.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">Hungrily,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">Casey</span></p>
