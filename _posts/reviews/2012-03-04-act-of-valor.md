<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><em><strong>Dear Anthony Carone,</strong> Yacht Henchman #1,</em></span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad I killed your ass.<strong> </strong><em>Act of Valor&rsquo;s</em> first-person shooter cinematography perfectly fed my fantasy of pulling the trigger &ndash; for America! Who cares that <em>Call of Duty: Army Approved </em>is just a big-screen military recruitment video? I&rsquo;ve already signed up. Because &ldquo;acting&rdquo; (ie. pretending) is for pussies. That&rsquo;s why they used actual Navy SEALs, live ammunition, and certified scum like you to keep shit real. I&rsquo;ll sleep better at night knowing we&rsquo;ve sent your cartoonish characterization of terrorism to a watery grave. Tell Cristo&rsquo;s Thug and Somalian they&rsquo;re next.</p>
<p>Gotta go &ndash; I&rsquo;m on a beach about to devirginate Yacht Girls 1, 2 and 3 to the soundtrack of <em>America, Fuck Yeah!</em> So suck it. Yup, you too.</p>
<p>No guts, no glory.<br />Christopher</p>
<p>P.S. You were the only Yacht Henchman. They just called you #1 to make you feel special.</p>
