<p><em><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Justin Benson,</strong> Screenwriter,</span></em></p>
<p>I have to say, writing <em>Resolution </em>couldn&rsquo;t have been an easy task<em>.</em>&nbsp; As clever and subversive as your script is (despite clear differences, its metafictional nature will inevitably draw comparisons to <em>The Cabin in the Woods</em>), this is the type of film that lives or dies based on the strength of its characters.&nbsp; With such a strong focus on dialogue and other intimate interpersonal moments, it&rsquo;s paramount that the viewer is able to completely empathise with the characters onscreen&mdash;or else there are no real emotional stakes.&nbsp; Kudos, then, for absolutely knocking it out of the park.</p>
<p>As two childhood best friends whose relationship is strained by drug addiction, Michael and Chris are the heart and soul of your story.&nbsp; Actors Peter Cilella and Vinny Curran share remarkable chemistry with each other, and perfectly compliment your knack for writing extremely realistic, natural sounding dialogue. These two guys feel completely genuine.&nbsp; Everything about their relationship works, from the petty digs to the earnest moments in which they reminisce about better times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because we&rsquo;re so invested in their lives, the film&#8217;s transition into the overtly supernatural, marked by the boys&#8217; dawning realization that they&rsquo;ve attracted the attention of an entity hopelessly beyond&nbsp; their comprehension, is all the more effective.&nbsp; Let me tell you something: I think of myself as being fairly jaded, but the fact that you can take something as mundane as two guys watching a videotaped conversation and make it absolutely bone-chilling speaks volumes as to your talent as a writer.&nbsp; Well done, sir, well done.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just two protagonists you&rsquo;ve so cleverly crafted. The supporting characters are just as strong, from the twitchy drug addicts who constantly seem seconds away from committing a terrible act of violence, to the reclusive French student who lends possible insight into the nature of the friends&#8217; predicament, to the stoic owner of the house Cilella has been unknowingly squatting in. They all captivate.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be perfectly honest: the first time watching I wasn&#8217;t sure how necessary these people were to the forward movement of the plot; it&rsquo;s impressive that, instead of simply being filler, you&rsquo;re able to make them essential to the resolution of the story.</p>
<p>I really admire your determination to avoid giving the audience an easy ending&mdash;or, for that matter, conveniently explaining what the entire movie was about. It may be polarizing for many people, to be sure, but it works.&nbsp; Personally, the ending is a <em>wee</em> bit too abrupt for my liking, but days later I still couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about it.&nbsp; And when so many genre pictures these days are of the in-one-ear-out-the-other variety, that&#8217;s about the highest compliment I can give.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> Sincerely,<br /> <br /> Kelan Young</p>
