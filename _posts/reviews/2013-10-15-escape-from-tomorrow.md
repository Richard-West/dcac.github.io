<p><em><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Christopher L. Perez,</strong> Clearance Counsel,</span></em></p>
<p>Those are some mighty big balls you&rsquo;ve got.&nbsp; Like, cartoonishly big. You&rsquo;re the one who ultimately told writer/director Randy Moore, sure, go ahead; risk a lawsuit from Disney &ndash; one of the most fiercely protected corporate identities in American history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you didn&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://escapefromtomorrow.com/">official website</a> for <em>Escape From Tomorrow</em> is throwing up a big middle finger at the notoriously litigious enterprise, featuring a big countdown clock titled &ldquo;number of hours since release that we haven&rsquo;t been sued&rdquo; (4 days, 13 hours, 41 minutes as of this posting). It&rsquo;s a dangerous game of chicken being played, but also a little transparent. You&rsquo;re obviously hoping a cease-and-desist order will allow you to market this as &ldquo;the film Disney doesn&rsquo;t want you to see!&rdquo;. Except it&rsquo;s more likely to be the film Disney doesn&rsquo;t care if you see, because it&rsquo;s just not that good.</p>
<p>Still, the audacity of secretly filming an entire feature film at both Disneyland and Disney World is no small feat. And for much of what unfolds on screen, I&rsquo;m not really surprised the crew got away with making this hand-held, black and white film. After all, it&rsquo;s simply the story of a man, his wife, and their two kids who are spending a day at the most magical place on earth as they endure spinning Tea Cups, long line-ups, and typical group separation anxieties. Shot with a few handheld 5D Mark II cameras, staging these scenes amongst the crowds wouldn&rsquo;t have phased a soul.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not even that uncommon for middle-aged men to navigate the whole park chasing young Lolitas who laugh and lick their lollipops in short-shorts as they frolic through the grounds. That&rsquo;s of course where the father (Roy Abramsohn) starts getting into trouble, before his mind starts to warp with surreal visions while on classic park rides like It&rsquo;s A Small World (that notably do not contain the most iconic, and lawsuit-worthy, characters).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fine line being walked at times, but it&rsquo;s strange where you advised your client to take precautions. Epcot Center is frequently named and featured, becoming a center point of the film&rsquo;s climax, and images of the Disney castle and name of the park are used early on. But as the film dips into a more twisted (and strangely less interesting) tale, the word &ldquo;Disney&rdquo; is spoken but bleeped out, Walter Disney is referred to simply as &ldquo;WD&rdquo;, and a bottle of lotion is black-bar censored (I&rsquo;m still trying to figure that one out). &nbsp;How and why these things all come together, both at a narrative and legal level, feel circumstantial, and don&rsquo;t evidence a deeper or more meaningful film. This is a novelty product that&rsquo;s more shameless than anything Disney itself has ever done. Including <a href="/letters/2013/8/14/planes.html">Planes</a>.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that for an indictment?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
