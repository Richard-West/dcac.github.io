<p class="Body">Hooray, you&rsquo;re back! This was your second shot at second unit directing the second <em>Jump Street</em> film. But rather than having a bad case of <em>d&eacute;j</em><em>&agrave; vu</em>, you probably felt even more comfortable in your role. The action scenes you directed this time were a little bigger, and even better suited to your <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1183872/"><span class="Hyperlink0">considerable experience</span></a> with stunts. The party scenes you handled were also a lot wilder, and, as a whole, <em>22 Jump Street </em>trades the element of <a href="/content/2012/3/15/sxsw-postcard-21-jump-street.html"><span class="Hyperlink0">surprise from the first film</span></a> for pure comedic satisfaction. That&rsquo;s quite an uncommon accomplishment for a sequel &ndash; especially one that&rsquo;s fixated on <em>being</em> a sequel.</p>
<p class="Body">The repeatedly self-referential narrative part of the film, however, didn&rsquo;t concern you. Why would it? Your job is always a bit repetitive anyway, working on all the connective tissue that <em>doesn</em><em>&rsquo;t</em> involve the stars &ndash; in this case, the establishing shots of the fictional &ldquo;Metro City&rdquo;, the transition scenes around campus, and the aforementioned action sequences using stunt performers. It&rsquo;s up to you to understand what the film is hoping to achieve, and to fit your set pieces into an established template. It&rsquo;s almost like making a sequel within a sequel.</p>
<p class="Body">Whoa. Did I just out-meta Phil Lord and Christopher Miller?</p>
<p class="Body">Hardly. The fact they were able to keep their pace for the entire runtime &ndash; actually,<em> longer</em> than the runtime with some incredible end credits &ndash; is fairly astonishing. Despite the overtly self-aware tone of the film, it never crosses into parody. This is mainly because Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum once again fully commit to their too-old-for-school undercover cop characters and never wink at the audience by acting above the material. Even the homoerotic bro-mance gets hit up so often that it actually changes from being a lazy joke to the entire point of the film. This obsession with a professional marriage no doubt comes by Lord and Miller honestly, as they represent an extremely rare case of non-sibling co-directors who have made several projects together (including the <a href="/content/2013/10/1/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-2.html"><span class="Hyperlink1">Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</span></a> films and <a href="/content/2014/2/7/the-lego-movie.html"><span class="Hyperlink1">The Lego Movie</span></a>). Their hot streak shows no signs of slowing down, either. If I were you, I&rsquo;d stick around.</p>
<p class="Body">Seeing double and loving it,</p>
