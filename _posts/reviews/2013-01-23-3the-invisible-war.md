<p><em style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Jonathan Dana</strong>, Distribution Advisor</em></p>
<p>Who wants to watch a movie of non-stop rape confessions? It&rsquo;s not a very appealing prospect for any distributor, but you obviously had a plan. The end credits tell us that the U.S. Secretary of Defense saw this film and two days later, took a small first step at correcting a major flaw in the U.S. military justice system that was portrayed in the film.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s proof that the people who don&rsquo;t want to see this film that are probably the ones that need to see it the most. And based on some alarming stats, there are a lot of people who need to see this movie.</p>
<p>In <em>The Invisible War</em>, director Kirby Dick investigates sexual assaults in the U.S. military and reveals disturbing statistics about how many cases are outright dismissed. We&rsquo;re not just talking about inappropriate comments, gestures or touching, but full-on rapes that leave women shattered for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; Many become suicidal and most lose complete faith in the institution they entrusted with their lives. This is not subject matter that people are ever going to feel &ldquo;in the mood&rdquo; to watch, so you had your work cut out for you.</p>
<p>The film opens with a classy intro weaving together the feel-good images of women joining the armed forces after the Second World War and gradually finding their places in the ranks. This optimism is then shattered by a chat roulette of confessions by women (and a man) who describe incidents in which they became victims of fellow soldiers they once considered &ldquo;brothers.&rdquo;&nbsp; One woman explains being sent down &ldquo;the gauntlet,&rdquo; a hallway of up to 200 intoxicated men who had their way with her.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not a pretty picture, and at least the audience is spared from any re-enactments. Because again, who would want to see this?</p>
<p>About halfway through the film, the story changes from a series of talking heads to follow a few former soldiers trying to take legal action. Coast Guard veteran Seaman Kori Cioca first tries to claim personal medical damages and then joins a class action lawsuit against the Army. The film doesn&rsquo;t invest much time in these pursuits (no doubt knowing there&rsquo;s no simple solution), but at least this offers the film, and the victims, some forward momentum.</p>
<p>The real boost, however, is likely to come from reactions to the film. Based on the film&rsquo;s Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary, you knew exactly who to show this film to so that it would get noticed. The Academy does tend to love activist films, so I hope making the problem visible leads to serious reforms. I do feel like the subject is now a little more real to me, even if I&rsquo;m not a very big fan of the pacing and perfunctory approach of the film itself.</p>
<p>Then again I&rsquo;m not your target audience, which I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d agree is a good thing.</p>
<p>Showing moral support,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
