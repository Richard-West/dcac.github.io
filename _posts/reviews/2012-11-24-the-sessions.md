<p>How&rsquo;s it going, girls? Long time no see (since <em>The Waterdance </em>twenty years go, to be exact). To tell the truth, I thought our relationship was over. Not even the cow-flinging winds of an F-5 <em>Twister </em>were enough to bring you back to me (even as I hoped against hope with each repeated VHS viewing). Then you won an Oscar with that wet T-shirt, and I figured, well, this is <em>As Good As it Gets</em>. You had matured and moved on and I managed, with great difficulty, to forget you.</p>
<p>Now, in <em>The Sessions</em>, you&rsquo;ve come out of retirement guns-a-blazin&rsquo; with a performance that features Natasha Henstridge-levels of exposure.  But you&rsquo;ve done so for a wonderful film that revels in the 90s (like me) and is the perfect vehicle to make your big comeback.</p>
<p>Writer and Director Ben Lewin&rsquo;s film is based on the true story of a man named Mark O&rsquo;Brien (John Hawkes) who lives with an iron lung and is functionally paralyzed. His story was the subject of <a href="http://www.snagfilms.com/films/title/breathing_lessons">Breathing Lessons</a>, the 1996 film by Jessica Yu that won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. <em>The Sessions</em>, however, makes the brave decision to focus only on the most titillating aspects of Mark&rsquo;s life. At age 38, he solicits the blessing of his priest (William H. Macy) to hire the de-virgining services of a sex surrogate. This is where you come in. Both of you.</p>
<p>Mark &ndash; and the movie &ndash; have sex on the brain. But the story rises well above lusty fantasies. The best parts are tender, touching, and revealing&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not just talking about you.</p>
<p>The film opens with a mix of archival news footage and Mark&rsquo;s own poetry, which remarks upon his struggles, triumphs, and ambitions. But more than wanting to become a journalist, Mark longs for simple pleasures, like having someone wash his hairy nipples without suffering though an attendant&rsquo;s sadistic &ldquo;you-need-me-more-than-I-need-you&rdquo; look. He longs for a gentle companion. Frankly, he longs for you.</p>
<p>When Mark is hired to write a research paper on sex for the disabled, we get a montage that educates us about the pleasures of nipple licking, unorthodox sex positions, and how weed helps numb nerves in your mouth to perform better cunnilingus. There&rsquo;s a lot early on to make you blush, but watching Mark squirm through these details (while his priest puts on a brave face) endears us to him all the more. Never more than when Mark explains how his penis speaks to him, but mainly through involuntary ejaculations as he&rsquo;s being bathed.</p>
<p>Helen Hunt is the polar opposite: controlled, calm, and commanding. She exposes you early and often as she performs body awareness exercises with Mark.  To his delight, she guides the back of his hand through breast etiquette: &ldquo;If you touch one, you have to touch the other. It&rsquo;s sort of a rule.&rdquo; Lessons of this type are apparently what separate sex surrogates from prostitutes, although the film doesn&rsquo;t split hairs. Besides being more introspective about her work (your work, really), she institutes a strict limit on the number of encounters, which becomes the film&rsquo;s inherit drama. She&rsquo;s less worried about overstaying her welcome than  about &rdquo;emotional transference&rdquo;. Basically, building elaborate long-term fantasies about her (I wouldn&rsquo;t know anything about that).</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done a great job, you two. I appreciate your bold decision to appear at this relatively late age, and I understand if we can never see each other again. Those are the rules, after all. But it was pretty great to break them&mdash;just this once.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
