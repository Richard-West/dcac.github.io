<p>Hey James, I just wanted to let you know how happy I am that the tinnitus you suffered mixing <em>Clash of the Titans</em> was not permanent. I knew your recovery from that cacophonous mess was complete listening to the quiet, almost reflective soundscape of <em>The Secret World of Arrietty</em>. And what a pleasure it is to watch an animated film that is not overstuffed with wise-cracking animals and fart noises, but has the confidence to rely on character, story, and tone to enrapture an audience.</p>
<p>Yours in silence,</p>
<p>Casey</p>
