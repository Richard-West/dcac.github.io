<p>Few people realize that Unit Production Managers are supposed to appear first in a film&rsquo;s end credits.&nbsp; Assuming, of course, that all the &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; actors and crew are in an <em>opening</em> credit sequence. It&rsquo;s one of those staunch union rules about respecting the hierarchy&mdash;the kind that made George Lucas quit the Director&rsquo;s Guild of America after making <em>Star Wars</em>. The sort of rule you might expect in a fraternity. And you know all about that now, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp;</p>
<p>While actors melt down and producers pull out their hair, you&rsquo;re usually in a nearby trailer, keeping the production afloat. In this sense, you&rsquo;re like the Zac Efron character in this movie (don&rsquo;t get too excited); he may be the face (and abs) of his Delta Psi frat house, but he&rsquo;s also a cunning negotiator who makes sure to appease the neighbors by greasing the right palms (and abs) so that he and his brothers can host their end-of-the-year dream party. Which, like most productions, starts off with a lot of promise, even when he meets his desperate-to-not-seem-lame new-parent neighbors. But that sort of civil order can&rsquo;t last, or else there wouldn&rsquo;t be a movie. And, equally, no need for people like you on set.</p>
<p>This being a Seth Rogan vehicle, the antics inevitably get juvenile. Farts are fanned, dope is smoked, breasts are milked, and homoeroticism reigns supreme. It gets to the point where a frat-saving scheme involves the boys raising $10,000 by selling dildo molds of their unnaturally different sized penises.</p>
<p>Like I said, you and Efron: unit production managers.</p>
<p>But it all makes sense. Frat house humour belongs in a frat house film. And as far as comedy goes, it does deliver a few good laughs. Efron doesn&rsquo;t have an ounce of Channing Tatum&rsquo;s conviction or comic timing, but at least he forewent the need for a <a href="/content/2014/1/30/that-awkward-moment.html">personal make-up artist</a> this time around. No room in the budget, I assume?</p>
<p>Rose Byrne even does her best to play along with the boys, but you can tell that writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O&rsquo;Brien are often unsure of what to do with her. But at least they&rsquo;ve made an effort to avoid the clich&eacute; of making the woman the wet blanket. Best to leave that job to you.</p>
<p>Signing off, after you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
