<p><em><strong><span style="font-size:130%;">Dear Devin Donegan, </span></strong><span style="font-size:130%;">Key Video Assist</span></em></p>
<p>Aside from generic clich&eacute;s about teamwork, parallels between professional sports and filmmaking aren&rsquo;t abundant. But there is one key similarity &ndash; the video assist. This modern piece of technology helps both athletes and actors assess their own performance, and the strategies of their counterparts, instantaneously.&nbsp; It also has the power to nearly end a wildly hot-tempered director&rsquo;s career when <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Qls1rAfYs">leaked online</a>, as I&rsquo;m sure your boss would like to forget. However, even if nothing viral-worthy happened on-set this time around, the final film is full of performances I&rsquo;m envious you got to watch over and over again.</p>
<p><em>Silver Linings Playbook,</em> director<em> </em>David O. Russell&rsquo;s exploration of rehabilitation, is at first a showcase for Bradley Cooper, playing Pat Solitano in the role of his career. Pat&rsquo;s a bipolar ex-teacher trying to make a comeback after an eight-month stint in a mental institution. He always speaks first and thinks later, while obsessessing over a single play he thinks will win him back his ex-wife. The tunnel vision distracts him from Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a formerly promiscuous pill-popper overcoming a tragedy herself and looking for a way to recover.</p>
<p>Tiffany&rsquo;s tactic is to go on the offensive, making rather explicit advances and appeals to Pat. Her approach feels like it&rsquo;s being looped on playback, as she constantly follows his jogging route to manufacture some not-so-subtle run-ins. These moments embrace some of the strongest dynamics of the film &ndash; a push and pull relationship that is expertly staged but somehow feels convincingly natural. Even Chris Tucker, who basically is only around for a re-occurring gag throughout the film, gives an impressively restrained performance without ever sacrificing a laugh.</p>
<p>Best of all, Robert DeNiro, as a superstitious football fanatic father, turns in his most well-rounded performance in years. He strikes a skilled balance of concern and care, before his own gambling addiction adds another layer to the drama. I imagine that watching the rushes of his performance, and the whole ensemble cast, helped you immediately realize you were working with a winner.</p>
<p>Beyond well-oiled comedy and believable idiosyncrasies, the film eventually packs an even bigger emotional punch than <em>The Fighter</em>. I was caught off guard by such well-earned misty moment, even if on paper if seems like the oldest play in the book. But swelling music or manipulative edits are nowhere to be found. I probably would have been just as affected by watching the raw footage.</p>
<p>So unlike you, I&rsquo;ll never know if there were only subtle differences between takes or dramatically different interpretations attempted by the actors. But what made the final cut certainly belongs in the big leagues.</p>
<p>Repeatedly yours,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
