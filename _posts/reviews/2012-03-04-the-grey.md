<p>I just wanted to say that I totally bought you as Dermot Mulroney, who, coincidentally, I totally bought as the nebbish member of the work crew. You both fought to survive, after a thrilling plane crash, an implausible series of wolf attacks and subarctic blizzards somewhere in darkest, coldest Alaska. All the surprising nuance that makes the movie work as a character study (if not completely as an action thriller) is evident when you go crashing through that tree towards the end; you really flailed your arms with Dermot Mulroney&rsquo;s unique double-jointed mobility. That&rsquo;s true craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />Jared</p></div>
