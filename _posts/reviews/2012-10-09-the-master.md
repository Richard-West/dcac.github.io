<p>Good day, sir. I hope this letter finds you well. I&rsquo;m writing to you in hopes of learning more about the program you&rsquo;re offering. I was at the local movie house recently and watched the newsreel documentary <em>The Master</em>, which reported on your curative relationship with the troubled drifter Freddie Quell. While I am not a naval veteran like Mr. Quell, and suffer only from mild versions of the sexual psychoses and alcoholic crackups that he does, I nonetheless believe that the psychological processing you put him through would be beneficial on my journey towards self-actualization.</p>
<p>You see, Freddie and I seek the same things in life: a coherent narrative, a few satisfying surprises, and perpetual aesthetic joy. And that is evidently what you offer, Mr. Dodd. And so I will state my intentions plainly: I would like to become a member of The Cause. I can assure you that my mind is wide open to new and exciting ways of exploring the spiritual world. Particularly the type of immortal cosmic adventuring you so eloquently promote.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think I would make a much better companion than Mr. Quell. I&rsquo;m much less erratic in my behavior, and much less prone to sudden outbursts of wild-eyed violence (and flatulence). He certainly is an odd fellow, wouldn&rsquo;t you say? He doesn&rsquo;t walk, but shambles. He doesn&rsquo;t speak, but grumbles. With his narrow shoulders and scarred face, he seems, in his physical presence alone, a proxy for the dark side of post-war America. The verve with which he performs his heedless antagonisms is almost frightening. Yet, he is perhaps the most fascinating fellow I&rsquo;ve met all year.</p>
<p>I wish Mr. Quell would have more clearly recognized the beauty inherent in the belief system you preach. The way you frame each scenario of your ecumenical mythology recalls a classical sort of visual design met with modern anarchistic perspectives. This is spiritual movement as high art. Immersive, subjective, sometimes lethargic, but ultimately edifying. I am very impressed.</p>
<p>Please answer this letter by sending me whatever literature I should familiarize myself with in preparation of my Processing. Please note that I am willing, also, to canvass outside local theatres to spread the word to non-believers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Master, I feel as if we&rsquo;ve already begun our journey together.</p>
<p>Your Humble Servant,</p>
<p>Jared Young</p>
