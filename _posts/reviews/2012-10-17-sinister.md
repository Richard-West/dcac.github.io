<p><em><strong>Dear Scott Derrickson</strong>, Writer</em></p>
<p>You horror writers must have to make a sort of Nietzschean bargain. You stare into the darkness and the darkness stares into you. &nbsp;Like Stephen King, you cobble together your disparate, very personal fears and build a story that will frighten strangers. You work carefully and quietly with your darlings. But things can go wrong. In <em>Sinister</em>, they go from strong beginnings to SLASH CRASH BLARGH. All the precious darlings are DEAD. <em>How did this happen?</em> It&rsquo;s a mystery with twist at the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the victims to understand the horror. First, you have your main protagonist Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), who is lovingly crafted as a &ldquo;true crime&rdquo; writer who may already have his best successes behind him. His is a universal fear, making it a wonderful driver for the plot. In a last-ditch effort to rekindle his career, he moves his family to a new town and home with the goal of writing a new book. His research takes a dark turn when he discovers evidence never found by the police.</p>
<p><em>But then this pretty great setup is turned&hellip;and devoured. </em>Oswalt proceeds to do so many things out of character that he is no longer compelling or even sympathetic. It&rsquo;s as if by some dark design that your work is put down. &nbsp;Just as Oswalt tilts almost to the point of deserving death, he then pulls back and becomes sort of sympathetic. In the end, you feel sort of &ldquo;meh&rdquo; about him. Who would turn your carefully crafted hero into this cretin, this narratively dead thing? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The next victim is fear itself. We are physical animals, with a highly-tuned limbic system that makes us fight or fly when we are scared. A sudden noise from the darkness can dissolve our pretense of higher-order being. This fear-trigger is the undying companion for any horror movie.</p>
<p>And yet, someone or <em>something </em>in <em>Sinister</em> methodically, mercilessly murders it. Every single time the beating soundscape and fast-paced scene cuts take a pause, it is followed by a loud surprising jump cut and loud noise. The relentless predictability turns the initial genuine terror into irritation and annoyance.</p>
<p>As the movie accelerates, the casualties pile up. Each one is a surprise. Japanese Horror&rsquo;s fear and fascination with media bludgeoned with an old-ish film projector. <em>Who could have done this? </em>I wonder.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Next it&rsquo;s our natural suspicion of small children, alien beings with whom we have only a passing understanding. Even they are put down, smothered by a strong controlling hand with some bad art and silly face paint. By this time, it&rsquo;s clear who the culprit is.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s the director. </em>In his zeal to make a commercially viable and broad horror movie, he has betrayed everything interesting that his writer gave him. He has swallowed up the movie with irrelevance and annoyance. <em>But why? But how?</em></p>
<p>At the end, the horrifying truth is revealed: the writer and director are THE SAME PERSON! NOISE! SCREAM! SCARY FACE!</p>
<p>Ambivalently Yours,</p>
<p>Cory</p>
