<p><em style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Bryan Burhoe,</strong> Shelby Mechanic,</em></p>
<p>Tell me, Bryan: how easy is it to know everything there is to know about a Ford Shelby GT500 Super Snake? I mean, more than just the fact that it has a supercharged 5.4 lire V8 engine that torques out 725hp, blah blah blah, I&rsquo;m talking about a true professional&rsquo;s understanding of its inner workings? Because <em>Getaway</em> makes is seem really, really easy. Just as easy as learning the most complicated aspects of camera circuitry, computer programming, civil engineering, international trade policies, and top-secret security banking protocols&mdash;all without any planning ahead!</p>
<p>Or maybe <em>Getaway</em> is blowing more hot air than a centrifugal super-charger on a &rsquo;68 Chevy Chevelle. Except all that exhaust is coming out of Selena Gomez, playing the most obnoxious co-star since Jar Jar Binks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gomez (who never gets a character name) is introduced to us through the context of a completely implausible car jacking, pulling a gun on Ethan Hawk&rsquo;s character. Sure she&rsquo;s is wearing a hoodie, but &ndash; surprise! &ndash; she&rsquo;s not a street thug! She&rsquo;s just some rich guy&rsquo;s daughter who wants her car back. See Hawke is driving it around some Bulgarian city like a madman, doing whatever an anonymous voice tells him in order to get his kidnapped wife back. It&rsquo;s like <em>Speed</em> meets <em>Taken </em>meets a car-wreck of a script</p>
<p>Sadly, the premise is actually the best part of the film (Ethan Hawk seems to be choosing his films based on their <a href="/letters/2013/6/13/the-purge.html">intriguing logline</a>). You and your team have a great excuse for covering the car in cameras and frantically cutting between shots, but somehow, Brian, that doesn&rsquo;t make the action any more exciting. Looking at the same problems from different angles doesn&rsquo;t inherently offer you a solution, just another view of what&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, a simple tune-up &ndash; re-casting Gomez or tweaking a few character choices &ndash; wouldn&rsquo;t quite do the trick. This story is built like those rocket-shaped super cars that only drive in a straight line and need a parachute to stop. No consideration has been put into maneuvering around plot points or appealing to the average moviegoer. It&rsquo;s all go, all the time, like the filmmakers are afraid that slowing down will give the audience time to think. As a result, we just feel detached and unsatisfied as the one-track story barrels ahead.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason the <em>Fast and Furious</em> movies are so successful, and it sure isn&rsquo;t because they only appeal to gear-heads like you. No matter how much <em>Getaway</em> features your precious Mustang at its center, it doesn&rsquo;t count as a compelling character deserving of our empathy.&nbsp; For most people, anyway.</p>
<p>Putting on the brakes,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
