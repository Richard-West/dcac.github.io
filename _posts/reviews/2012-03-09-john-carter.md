<p>Anyone can draw slutty costumes. Apparently, even Disney. The trick is to be able to pull them off &ndash; and maybe put them back on. Loin cloths. Breast plates. Chest plates. Butt flaps. Dude, your job sounds like the bisexual dream!</p>
<p>But where do you draw the line? I mean that literally &ndash; Disney must have a mathematical formula for the percentage of buttocks that can be flashed in a family film.  I&rsquo;m guessing that, like a naughty catholic schoolgirl, you had your actors tense up their shoulders and stretch out their fingertips to show every extra skin cell the rulebook would allow. Maybe that&rsquo;s why amid the hundreds of millions of dollars put into this production, my eyes were still pathetically drawn to the most carnal of human pleasures. How much of Lynn Collin&rsquo;s leg are they going to show? How&rsquo;s that old woman going to pull off that gown? Did they just digitally erase Taylor Kitch&rsquo;s buttcrack? That&rsquo;s when I knew there was a problem.</p>
<p>To his credit, director Andrew Stanton does not leave much to the imagination anywhere. But like you, he too often just seems to be doing what&rsquo;s fitting. We&rsquo;ve literally and figuratively seen so many cowboy vs. aliens stories lately that simply using ancient material (by sci-fi standards) isn&rsquo;t enough. You need to still create something bold and new, even if there are only so many ways to drape a story. Genre geeks will find plenty to enjoy, but for the rest of us, most of what we&rsquo;re experiencing feels over-worn. Sign me up for attending the Cosplay parties though.</p>
<p>Hang in there,</p>
