How else would someone like you, who diligently lists off the hard work of others, ever get any recognition of your own? When the credits for <em>The Guilt Trip</em> rolled, your name was nowhere to be seen &ndash; even though you were directly responsible for getting all those names out there. You&rsquo;re not alone. Mothers, too, know a little something about being ironically overlooked. So it&rsquo;s nice to see a film acknowledge the pains and joys of this type of selfless, unacknowledged devotion. And even more rare to do so without ever nagging the audience.</p><p>Director Anne Fletcher is the steady hand behind the wheel of this family bonding road trip. When young entrepreneur Andrew Brewster (Seth Rogan) learns about his mother&rsquo;s first love before driving cross-country for his business, he invites her to come along for the ride with the hidden goal of meeting the man he was named after. Barbra Streisand hits a comedic homerun as Joyce Brewster, striking an impressive balance of capturing the overbearing concerns of a mother without ever descending into parody. For his part, Rogan dials back his typically foul-mouthed antics and presents a son that&rsquo;s not exactly ungrateful or spoiled, but afraid to confront his faults.</p><p>This is a safe film. It&rsquo;s a nice film. It&rsquo;s the kind of film I wish I would have seen with my mom (I never know what&rsquo;s safe to see together after suffering through that otherwise fantastic lesbian scene in <em>Chloe</em>). And while <em>The Guilt Trip</em> doesn&rsquo;t deserve to the level of praise a mother may bestow upon her only son, it shouldn&rsquo;t be dismissed like someone who has to hear those same praises either. The film is a gentle ride without any twists and turns that usually come with this type of trip. What the story loses by being a little quaint, it usually makes up for by feeling genuine. Also, by focusing on the core mother-son relationship, and keeping any secondary characters at arms length, we get time to fully enjoy Streisand&rsquo;s unique brand of humour. She alone is worth the trip to the theatre.</p><p>You probably don&rsquo;t do your job for the praise, but if the film teaches us anything, it&rsquo;s that everyone needs a little boost now and then. So good job, and let&rsquo;s all make a bigger effort to not overlook the often thankless roles out there.</p><p>Administering you some credit,</p><p>Christopher</p><p><strong><em>Status: Standard Delivery (3/5)</em></strong></p></div>
