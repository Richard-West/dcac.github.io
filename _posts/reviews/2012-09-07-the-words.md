<p>You&rsquo;ve had a hell of a career, fellas. I think it&rsquo;s safe to say you&rsquo;ve contributed amply to Mr. Quaid&rsquo;s success; for him to be more than just a pretty face something needed to democratize his steely good-looks, and the earthy resonance you produce &ndash; both gritty and articulate, like rusty guitar strings strummed by a virtuoso &ndash; has been as vital to his charm as that squint, that grin, that loping stride.</p>
<p>In <em>The Words</em>, Mr. Quaid plays novelist Clay Hammond&mdash;but it&rsquo;s you, his twin layrngal mucous membranes, who really take center stage, modulating the air expelled by his lungs to form the words that narrate the film. The conceit is this: Hammond is reading a passage from his latest book in front of an adoring crowd, and the story-within-a-story follows an aspiring writer (Bradley Cooper), who, after much rejection and repudiation, discovers his salvation in a Parisian junk shop: a forgotten novel manuscript that he passes off as his own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s immediately evident, from the very first line you&rsquo;re asked to deliver &ndash; which is supposed to be the opening line of a critically-acclaimed novel, but instead sounds like something poached from a teenage girl&rsquo;s poetry journal &ndash; that this film doesn&rsquo;t take place in the real world. <em>The Words</em> is all conspicuous plot movement, convenient character beats, and simple sentiment&mdash;the life of a novelist as seen through the dramatic lens of <em>As The World Turns</em>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s your fault, guys. To be honest, you sounded a bit strained. Stretched to your physiological limits. Unnaturally vacillated. Indeed, the way the Mr. Quaid uses you, projecting a deadpan reading voice that enunciates each word as an individual phoneme, putting emphasis and accents in the strangest places, makes his voice-over feel somehow eloquent and empty at the same time. The whole film strains awkwardly for profundity in the same way.</p>
<p>We get the fantastical writing-the-book scene, as the committed novelist hammers at his keyboard, pauses to think, nods, and continues to hammer (am I the only one who, in the act of writing, only touches the keyboard about ten-percent of the time?). We get a scene of a drunk stumbling down a cobblestone street, humming to himself, tipping a half-empty bottle down his throat with all the subtlety of an <em>Abbott &amp; Costello</em> routine. And Cooper is doe-eyed throughout, making earnest pronouncements about chasing his dreams, giving precociously humble speeches at awards ceremonies. All the swagger with which he coasted so comfortably through films like <em>The Hangover</em> and <em>Limitless </em>is gone; here he&rsquo;s the leading-man equivalent of one of those motivational posters with a mountaineer silhouetted against the sunset.</p>
<p>Mr. Quaid&rsquo;s struggles to keep you in tune wouldn&rsquo;t stand out so much if it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that you&rsquo;re not the only pair of vocal cords driving the narrative forward. In the story-within-a-story-<em>within-a-story</em> that makes up much of the second half of the film, Jeremy Irons brings his accomplished oscillating folds onto the soundtrack. He&rsquo;s one of the all-time masters, and I&rsquo;ll be honest, friends, his adductions and abductions put you to shame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it might not be your finest performance, you&rsquo;ve certainly earned your paycheck (how exactly does Mr. Quaid divide his profits between you and his chin-dimple and that lock of hair that always falls perfectly over his right eye?). Take a break, relax, enjoy a cup of hot Earl Grey with a bit of honey and lemon. There wasn&rsquo;t much you could do. Your rough phonation is too real, too scabrous and sincere, for a film that is interested only in histrionic notions of art.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jared Young</p>
