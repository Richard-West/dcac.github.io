<p>It&rsquo;s hard not to be impressed by the riches on display in <em>The Intouchables</em>. I&rsquo;m not just talking about your sets, which do a great job of contrasting social clashes that are key to Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano&rsquo;s feature film, but also the depth of talent on display. Even more impressive is how this unlikely tale has translated into one of the biggest box-office hits in European history.</p>
<p>In one sense, I could argue your task was easy. It doesn&rsquo;t take much imagination to contrast the lives of a poor African immigrant, played brilliantly by Omar Sy, with an out-of-touch French bourgeois portrayed by Fran&ccedil;ois Cluzet, whom he&rsquo;s tasked with caring for. As an audience, we&rsquo;ve been here, seen that before. Yet the results are rarely ever this satisfying.</p>
<p>The basic set pieces on screen feel like they came from a pawn shop of Hollywood clich&eacute;s: a poor, uneducated free-spirit, a rich, up-tight <em>enfant gate,</em> and a journey through melancholy to rediscover purpose and love. Disney has been using this formula for ages. They&rsquo;ve just never made it a platonic love story between a street thug and a wealthy quadriplegic.</p>
<p>Together, you&rsquo;ve built a world we at once recognize, sympathize with, and envy. You make it easy to share Sy&rsquo;s joy as we see him soaking up his new gold-plated bathroom only days after he seemed doomed to the indignity of bathing in a housing project full of needy children. Moments of spontaneity also help lock us into place, like the brilliant flash-forward opening sequence. We see the unorthodox relationship bloom as the two race through Parisien streets. We get hooked, and care about where this story is going, even if we&rsquo;ve been there before.</p>
<p>The result is funny, touching, and a breath of fresh air. In other words, you and your team really classed up the joint &ndash; even when it was filled with prostitutes and actual joints.</p>
<p>A bientot!</p>
