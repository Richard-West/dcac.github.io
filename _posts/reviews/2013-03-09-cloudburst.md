<p><em style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Tim Webber</strong>, Craft Services</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a well-known secret in low-budget filmmaking that if you keep the crew fed, you&rsquo;ll keep them happy. The same principle applies to corporate conferences, foreign wars, and basically anywhere else people don&rsquo;t want to be. Sure, some zealous upstarts will jump at any chance to get ahead, but there comes a point when, to attract proven talent, you need to offer something in return. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So what the hell kind of delicious meals did you prepare to attract Academy Award winners Olympia Dukakis and Brenda Fricker to this movie?</p>
<p>The first meal they would have been fed, of course, was the script. <em>Cloudburst</em> is the story of two septuagenarian women in a closeted relationship. Stella (Olympia Dukakis) is your classic butch: a foul-mouthed, cantankerous, cowboy hat-wearing spinster. Her &ldquo;roommate&rdquo; of the past 31 years, Dot (Brenda Frick), is a the sweeter, more optimistic soul. Dot is also visually impaired, but, get this&mdash;it&rsquo;s her daughter Molly (Kristin Booth) who is blind to the two women&rsquo;s romantic relationship. The irony! So Molly tries to have her mom committed to a home and take over the family property. This leads the elderly lovers to break her out of their long-term care facility and make their way to Canada where they can legally marry. It&rsquo;s actually an extremely palatable story&mdash;one that I can personally relate to, having an Aunt in a similar situation.</p>
<p>But even though he wrote the recipe for the script (originally a stage play), director Thom Fitzgerald proves to be a huge liability behind the camera.&nbsp; He seems to have no clue when to let a joke simmer, when to pull out of a scene, no flare for presentation. The multiple sunset shots are painfully overcooked with yellows, the editing is sluggish, and the film suffers from a terribly weak soundtrack. It&rsquo;s a recipe for disaster, and often times is, but the two leads are so lip-smacking good that I was able to choke down the rest.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ll give credit where credit is due. Fitzgerald manages to coax his dames into dildo fights, sermons on the word <em>cunt</em>, shitting into bidets, and faceplanting into bare ball-sacks. Even Judd Apatow couldn&rsquo;t get an actor to do half these things. I&rsquo;m pretty sure your daily menu must have included your &ldquo;special&rdquo; brownies and a few magic mushrooms.</p>
<p>But, hey, whatever you have to do. You got the right actors to give the film a little zest, and now all you need is a better appetizer&mdash;the current trailer is seriously the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ce-6-SX_6dQ#!">worst I&rsquo;ve ever seen</a>.</p>
<p>Tipping out,</p>
