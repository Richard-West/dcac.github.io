<p><em><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Contanza Garcia</strong>, Make-up and Tattoo Artist,</span></em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;ve never seen that HBSC &ldquo;Your Point of View&rdquo; campaign. You know, the one where images of, say, tattoos and henna, swap headlines like &ldquo;Trendy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Traditional&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s rather brilliant, reminding us that culture, preference and personal experience has an ability to challenge stereotypes. Not even a modicum of that nuance has made it way into <em>Aftershock</em>. Everyone you&rsquo;ve given a tattoo is instantly &ndash; and lethally &ndash; labeled &ldquo;Slut&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rapist&rdquo;. But that&rsquo;s just the beginning of the clich&eacute;s in an earthquake movie that sure has a hard time shaking things up.</p>
<p>It begins with the characters &ndash; or should I say caricatures. Set in Chile, we have &ldquo;Gringo&rdquo; (Eli Roth), a white American traveler who doesn&rsquo;t speak Spanish. Then there&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pollo&rdquo; (Nicol&aacute;s Mart&iacute;nez), which is Spanish for &ldquo;chicken&rdquo;, so naturally he spends most of his time running around scared with his head &ndash; actually, hand &ndash; cut off. There&rsquo;s also Irina (Natasha Yarovenko) a Russian model who simply has to look the part, Ariel (Ariel Levy) a fat, loud-mouth womanizer who fit the bill so well they didn&rsquo;t bother to change the actor&rsquo;s name, a good girl short-haired sister (Andrea Osv&agrave;rt), bad girl long-haired sister (Lorenza Izzo), and a laundry list of others like &ldquo;Firefighter&rdquo;, &ldquo;Priest&rdquo; and &ldquo;Grumpy Operator&rdquo; &ndash; each of which is given a rather significant moment in the film. Significant, of course, in that predetermined one-dimensional sort of way.</p>
<p>Even Selena Gomez a gives a completely useless &ldquo;special appearance&rdquo; in the film, playing a stuck-up snob in a club credited as &ldquo;V.I.P. Girl&rdquo;. Another ground breaking character choice, I know.</p>
<p>So after meandering between wine tasting tours and dance clubs, the story finally finds a pulse when the earthquake hits. We know this is happening because the camera shakes a whole lot and people run around waving their arms in the air. The set pieces start falling and crushing people, sometimes to both shocking and hilarious effect. Initially, I was teased into thinking the film may be taking these cues from the <em>Final Destination</em> series (a personal favorite), but instead it strangely side-steps into a simple horror story about running away from escaped prisoners with nothing but rape on the mind. Identified, of course, by simply having tattoos.</p>
<p>The film is not without its fun surprises, namely the ability to discard its characters with the same carelessness they were thought up. And being made with a measly budget of $2 million, I&rsquo;m more inclined to applaud some of the camera tricks than I am to point out the obvious cheats. But at the end of the day, this is a movie that will barely register on the Richter scale of disaster films.</p>
<p>Saving myself,</p>

<p>P.S. On the plus side, this film made me appreciate that Australian tsunami-plus-killer-shark B-movie <em>Bait</em> even more. Go watch that instead.</p></div>
