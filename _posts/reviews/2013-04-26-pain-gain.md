<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><strong><em>Dear Ashley Metzel,</em></strong><em> Set Dresser,</em></span></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as small in a Michael Bay film. And I have a feeling that this truth is relevant even to the less glamorous jobs on set. Though I suspect that set dressing occupies a place of importance when Bay is in the director&rsquo;s chair; his films are primarily interested in trying to show the world in the coolest, sexiest, most epic way possible. In a sense, <em>everything</em> in a Michael Bay film is set dressing: cars, helicopters, Megan Fox.</p>
<p><em>Pain &amp; Gain</em> is shot with the same low-angle, high-saturation awe with which Bay seeks to give every character a god-like glow. It still loses its focus in scenes that fetishize luxury (placing more importance on your set dressings than the story), and it&rsquo;s still guided by the same homophobic, misogynistic, bro-centric vision that made films like <em>Bad Boys, Armageddon,</em> and<em> The Rock </em>so risible.</p>
<p>However, because <em>Pain &amp; Gain</em> is the story of incompetent kidnapping and accidental murder set in Miami&rsquo;s bodybuilding subculture, Bay has found the perfect place to indulge in these aesthetics. It&rsquo;s a place where his particular brand of objectification makes complete sense. Sure, as in his previous films these characters are treated and photographed as objects of desire; but the thing is, these characters would <em>love</em> that.</p>
<p>Mark Wahlberg, playing personal trainer Daniel Lugo, often speaks of the American Dream he thinks he&rsquo;s owed, even quoting a tenet of the I-deserve-it-all ethos of <em>The Secret: </em>&ldquo;If you deserve it, the universe will serve it.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s talking, really, about all the ostentation with which you populate Bay&rsquo;s sets. In Lugo&rsquo;s all-or-nothing view, everything and everyone who impedes his march is disposable, objects to be tossed aside in pursuit of his dream. He wants the oceanside house, the <em>Miami </em>Vice-style cigar boat, the Porsche <em>and</em> the Lamborghini. He wants to live in a Michael Bay film.</p>
<p>Could Michael Bay possess this much &nbsp;self-awareness? Did you detect a master plan when dressing sets that are almost a parody of the American consumer ideal? More importantly, does it matter? Even if this self-criticism is unintentional, it&rsquo;s there on the screen. The three main characters are physical embodiments of Bay&rsquo;s bigger-is-better approach to&hellip;well, everything. This physicality also reflects the high costs of such a lifestyle: the mutation of self-image; literal impotence. That this all comes through in sly, affecting performances by Wahlberg, Anthony Mackie, and especially Dwayne &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson, just added to my disorientation.</p>
<p>Not that everything works on this meta level. <em>Pain &amp; Gain</em> is still overstuffed. It <em>&nbsp;</em>runs a bloated 130 minutes, padded out by overindulgent slow motion, freeze frames, and other Bayian (I&rsquo;m trademarking that adjective) flourishes. But maybe that&rsquo;s the point. Maybe the filmmaking is a criticism of itself. In <em>Pain &amp; Gain&rsquo;s</em> world, you either go all in or you go home. And the film itself &ndash; the style, the length, the overindulgence, and, yes, even the set dressing &ndash; follow suit in order to maintain some sense of thematic integrity.</p>
<p>And, at this point in his career, a little honesty from Michael bay feels like progress.</p>
<p>Dreaming of the simple life,</p>
