<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><em><strong>Dear Randall Poster</strong>, Music Supervisor,</em></span></p>
<p>Capturing the youthful rebellions of another time on film is tricky.&nbsp; The things that once felt dangerous and subversive turn quaint as they become our parents and grandparents&rsquo; eras. By the time we hit great-grandparents, well, it&rsquo;s hard to separate the rebels from the squares amongst all the period costumes and sets.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s probably tempting to take a shortcut by giving modern audiences something familiar to grasp onto rather than doing a lot of world building. Too bad you gave in to this temptation by leaning on music from bands like TV On The Radio and Bloc Party to make-up for the faults in this mid-1940&rsquo;s set film.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, if you were working with a director like Baz Luhrman, you could get away with it. But Luhrman is a magpie &ndash; he&rsquo;s constructing his world out of those pieces. The mash-up is the point.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in <em>Kill Your Darlings</em>, director John Krokidas seems to be asking something different of your soundtrack &ndash; he wants the jazz for the period feel, the classical music to show that his characters are intellectual, and the alt-pop to give them a more modern edge. &nbsp;It ends up being a bad mix, with those contemporary songs belonging on an angsty teen TV show rather than a literary drama.</p>
<p>Based on an actual 1944 murder involving friends of the college-age pre-Beat writers, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, <em>Kill Your Darlings</em> is also meant to show the birth of a literary movement that resonated for decades.&nbsp; Daniel Radcliffe at least does a good job of conveying the evolution of Ginsberg&rsquo;s sexuality and writing style, things that would set him on the fringes of his society.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the movie doesn&rsquo;t show us what Ginsberg and his friends were rebelling against. The movie mentions homophobia, anti-Semitism, and the peril of a world at war, but they only give us a sense rather than the crushing weight it must have been.&nbsp; The movie spends more time on the oppression of poetic rhyme schemes &ndash; deadening to be sure (especially to a music enthusiast like you), but not something that really engages the average audience.</p>
<p>As music supervisor, there are much better options you could have presented to the director.&nbsp; Last year&rsquo;s <a href="/letters/2012/5/28/on-the-road.html"><em>On the Road</em></a> had its flaws, but it was able to convey the audacity of jazz.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t fun swing, or moody torch songs, but raw-edged bebop.&nbsp; In that movie, when we saw Kerouac and Ginsberg dancing sweaty in a proto-moshpit, it was easy to understand how this music would concern the authorities and stir up the youth.&nbsp; Here, the most we see is Radcliffe doing some enthusiastic table drumming.&nbsp; No wonder you and Krokidas thought you needed to bring in the modern music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that there aren&rsquo;t things in the film that work and work well. Radcliffe and Michael C. Hall both do excellent jobs of making us forget that they&rsquo;re best known for other work, and Ben Foster as Burroughs is a treat. &nbsp;Dane DeHaan as the murderous Lucien Carr has the charm of a baby DiCaprio, though somewhat hampered by overly arch dialogue.&nbsp; The story itself is an interesting one, with Hall&rsquo;s character being both stalker and mentor to Carr, while Carr is manipulative enough that it&rsquo;s hard to believe his version of events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Krokidas had trusted his actors and story more the movie might have had a chance to sing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Erin</p>
