<p>Given the premise of <em>Contracted</em> &ndash; a young woman stricken with a mysterious disease that corrupts her body in unfathomable ways &ndash; &nbsp;it&#8217;s pretty impressive how restrained your makeup effects are.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t get me wrong&mdash;while you conjure up some undeniably nightmarish body-horror imagery, it never feels like you&#8217;re aiming for cheap shocks; on more than one occasion you opt to let the viewer&rsquo;s imagination fill in the blanks, and, in an age where so much special effects work seems to be driven by a &#8220;the goopier the better&#8221; philosophy, that kind of restraint is especially refreshing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame, then, that writer/director Eric England&#8217;s script undercuts your work so severely.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s certainly no fault to be attributed to lead actor Najarra Townsend, who seems entirely committed to the role and turns in a pretty fearless performance. But there&#8217;s very little depth to her character, making her gradual deterioration at your hands less meaningful than it should be.&nbsp; We can empathize with her on a physical level, but that&#8217;s really about it.&nbsp; The screenplay has her entangled in a series of relationships in which absolutely nobody seems to have her best interests in mind (save perhaps for her domineering mother) which is a pretty cheap ploy to earn audience sympathy; to believe that someone would willingly surround themselves with so many loathsome, two-faced &ldquo;friends&rdquo; strains credibility far more than the actual horror elements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The film&#8217;s biggest problem, far and away, is falling back on the &#8220;everyone is a deaf and blind idiot&#8221; convention.&nbsp; As you make Townsend&#8217;s visage increasingly hideous, the more unfathomable it becomes that absolutely <em>no one</em> around her grasps the severity of the situation&mdash;even going so far as to outright ignore her pleas for help. As she (literally) falls to pieces before their very eyes, the common response is basically: &#8220;Eeew, please stop being so gross, you idiot.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&#8217;s an infuriating way to advance the plot, and becomes so cartoonish that it&rsquo;s not even that satisfying when a few choice individuals get their much deserved comeuppance.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say this movie is a total wash, though, since you turn in some undeniably impressive effects work, most notably a climatic scene involving maggots that is sure to drop the jaws of even the most hardened horror fans.&nbsp; It could also be that I&#8217;m just not quick-witted enough to have figured it out beforehand, but there is a fun moment towards the end when the true nature of what is happening to our protagonist is finally revealed.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope to see you continue to work in the horror genre. If your makeup expertise was paired with a stronger script, the results would be nothing short of outstanding.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Kelan</p>
