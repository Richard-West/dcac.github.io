<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><em><strong>Dear Joshua L. Pearson,</strong> Editor</em></span></p>
<p>Screw you man.</p>
<p>No, seriously.</p>
<p>Editing a documentary&mdash;especially one with so much musical performance&mdash;is a truly difficult task. And you made it look easy. Those scenes of Paul Simon reuniting with the South African musicians from <em>Graceland</em>? Masterful&mdash;they perfectly captured the joy of these artists playing together</p>
<p>Was structuring the film around the sit-down between Simon and Dali Trambo, the founder of Artists Against Apartheid your idea as well? It reminds me of one of director Joe Berlinger&rsquo;s earlier collaborations with co-director Bruce Sinofsky, <em>Metallica: Some Kind of Monster. </em>Either way, it was a nice way to represent both sides of the controversy that sprung up around Simon&rsquo;s<em> </em>1985 seminal album<em>. </em>Maybe in the end, Simon&rsquo;s side<em> </em>gets a little more attention (the film clearly sides with that), but the depiction was much more even handed than I expected.</p>
<p>Sadly, editing this seamless and effective often goes unnoticed, so take it as a compliment when no one mentions how well this film is put together. Well, no one except for me.</p>
<p>So in summary: screw you.</p>
<p>Yours in annoyance,</p>
