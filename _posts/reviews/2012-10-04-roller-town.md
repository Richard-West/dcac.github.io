<p>&ldquo;Roller disco double dicker.&rdquo; That was you, wasn&rsquo;t it? Or are you the type of gal who threatens to &ldquo;ground up like pepper&rdquo; your misbehaving shame-baby? No, these rather hilarious and random lines are from the twisted minds of Picnicface, the online comedy troupe behind <em>Roller Town</em>. You, on the other hand, are simply one of the many donors who helped make their big screen debut possible. The other self-credited benefactors include raptor tamers, fruit hypnotizers, and pepperoni stick samurais. And if any of you had actually showed up on-set, you undoubtedly would have been included in this everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink-plus-the-hair-in the-drain comedy.</p>
<p><em>Roller Town</em> is a tour-de-<em>farce</em> by Generation YouTube&rsquo;s Canadian wunderkinds. Picnicface got their own Comedy Network TV series, but stepping into film is always much more daunting (as their forebears from like <em>Saturday Night Live</em> and <em>The Kids in the Hall </em>can attest). Rarely can specialists in short-form humor successfully stretch a skit over an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Well, I LOL&rsquo;ed &ndash; for real &ndash; multiple times. So something obviously worked.</p>
<p>The year is 1970-something, and disco isn&rsquo;t just dying, it&rsquo;s being murdered. No-nonsense arcade pushers are forcing Mouth Wheel machines (aka Pac-Man) into the small town roller discos of Canada. They&rsquo;re doing more than just killing the funk&mdash;they&rsquo;re killing people, and even themselves, to prove how ridiculously serious they are. The only man brave enough to roll up against them is Leo (Mark Little), a defiant skater who for some reason is constantly, humiliatingly, rejected by the Royal Roller Academy.&nbsp; Now he gets a chance to finally prove his groove. Along the way, he also attempts to win over Julia (Kayla Lorette), the girl of his dreams. And there you have it: all the mandatory plot points to ride out a feature film. But who cares? It&rsquo;s the random stops along the way that make this film worthwhile.</p>
<p>Leo&rsquo;s facemashing during a makeout session with Julia. The seven belts Grandpa wears over his sweatpants. A hobo corn-fucker hiding in the fields. And, of course, the musical disco interludes. These are just a few arbitrary examples of what, against all logic, worked for me. The film as a whole suffers from numerous trappings of a low budget feature: the sound design is weak, the cinematography is inconsistent, and the scale always feels limited. But when it comes to comedy, there&rsquo;s only one objective measurement that matters. Laughter. And more than a few jokes land right where they&rsquo;re supposed to. Even the romance manages a strange brew of chemistry. I&rsquo;ll be damned if I didn&rsquo;t fall for Julia&rsquo;s crooked smile by the end of it all.</p>
<p>So check your watch, brave supporter, and sing along with me: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a quarter to dick. It&rsquo;s a half past pussy. It&rsquo;s fuck o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;. No? Not random enough for you?</p>
<p>Arbitrarily yours,</p>
