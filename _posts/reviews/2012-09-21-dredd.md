<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><strong><em>Dear Oliver Allen-Wielebnowski,</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Stereoscopic Conversion Lead,</em></span></p>
<p>Boy do I hate seeing credits like yours in movies. You belong to the group of technicians that take films shot in 2D&mdash;a format that has served cinematic storytelling just fine, thank you very much, for over 100 years&mdash;and turn them into dim, muddled visual messes that are at best&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926084/">passable</a>, and at worst,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0938283/">atrocities</a>.<a name="back1"></a><a href="#1">1</a>&nbsp;So colour me shocked that I found myself appreciating not just the movie, but your&nbsp; work specifically in&nbsp;<em>Dredd&nbsp;</em>(AKA&nbsp;<em>Dredd 3D,</em>for the more easily confused filmgoers, I guess). And I don&rsquo;t mean I enjoyed it in a &ldquo;when I say the 3D was good that means I didn&rsquo;t really notice it&rdquo; way, either. It very much enhanced the film in the way it was (I assume) meant to be enhanced. You&rsquo;ll get no harsh judgments from me here.</p>
<p>Granted, there may have never been a plot conceit so suited to the merits of 3D as the narcotic that is the catalyst of much of&nbsp;<em>Dredd</em>&rsquo;s mayhem. &ldquo;Slo-mo&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s called, is said to slow the perception of time down to &ldquo;1 percent of normal&rdquo; (because in the future, this is apparently measureable), heightening the user&rsquo;s surroundings. The 3D really shines here, effectively putting us inside the heads of an addict. During these sequences, it feels like we can focus on every detail at an almost a molecular level.</p>
<p>With all that effort lavished on just the drug sequences, the filmmakers must have paid as much attention on the plot, right? Well, no. The basic premise of&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Dredd</em>&nbsp;is about two parts&nbsp;<em>Robocop</em>, a half part&nbsp;<em>Die Hard,&nbsp;</em>one part&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner,</em>&nbsp;and five&nbsp; parts&nbsp;<em>The Raid: Redemption.</em><a name="back2"></a><a href="#2">2</a><em>&nbsp;</em>Badass supercop (Karl Urban as the titular Judge Dredd) in a futuristic mega city (named, aptly enough, Mega City One) descends on a complex controlled by a drug lord (Lena Heady) and must make his way to the top to dispense, well, judgement. Accompanying him is a hopeful-Judge-in-training(Olivia Thirlby), who Dredd helpfully refers to as &ldquo;Rookie&rdquo; (so add maybe another 1 part&nbsp;<em>The Rookie</em>&nbsp;into that plot formula). But like my appreciation of your 3D work&mdash;something I&rsquo;m usually adverse to&mdash;I appreciated this stripped down formula.&nbsp;<em>Dredd&nbsp;</em>introduces its scenario efficiently, and gets right to the action with no apologies.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Now if we&rsquo;re going to talk about a well executed movie and your 3D contributions, it only seems natural to discuss the three dimensional characters as well, doesn&rsquo;t it? Sure it does, except there aren&rsquo;t any here. And again, against the odds, this didn&rsquo;t bother me. Even in John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra&rsquo;s original comic, Judge Dredd was the very definition of caricature; in fact that was his point. And it&rsquo;s a credit to screenwriter Alex Garland and director Pete Travis that they don&rsquo;t feel the need to add conventional motivations and back story to Dredd (Thirlby&rsquo;s Anderson gets the token amount). I may have just been happy that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucZT8EepU50">Rob Schneider didn&#8217;t show up to ruin the movie</a>, but I don&#8217;t think so. Overall, they work like Dredd &ndash; decisive action says everything you need</p>
<p>And in today&rsquo;s action movie environment, that&rsquo;s a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Monoscopically yours,</p>

<li><a name="2"></a>I have read that the Raid: Redemption similarities are purely coincidental. Given the original comic&rsquo;s use of blocks (huge skyscrapers) as city architecture, I can buy that. The similarities to Robocop&mdash;including an opening chase of criminals in a van&mdash;I can only read as intentional.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#back2">↩</a></li>
