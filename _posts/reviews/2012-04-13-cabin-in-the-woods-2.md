<p>You are the only person involved in this film that I will give a free pass. You aren&rsquo;t paid to question the writer&rsquo;s motivations or the director&#8217;s vision. After reading this script, you just knew it was a portfolio jackpot and never looked back, right? Well, you&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>I stepped out of the theater with question after unresolvable question popping up in my head. This wasn&rsquo;t&rsquo; the satisfying puzzlement that cleverly ambiguous or intellectually intriguing films inspire, but simple bafflement at how the entire premise was so thinly strung together. It&rsquo;s a first-class case of half-baked ideas buried under a steaming pile of over-indulgence.</p>
<p>I expect a lot more from co-writer and producer Joss Wheland in particular, a respected leader in modern geek culture. But this comedy/horror/sci-fi/fantasy mash-up makes its genres strangely cancel out their individual effectiveness (O Edgar Wright, where art thou?). The result is a film that aims at post-modern pastiche and ends up feeling like mindless pandering to a very specific fan base. Perhaps director Drew Goddard thought your creations, made with love and care, would be so good that people would simply turn off their brains to a concept so severely flawed it should never exist in the first place. Unfortunately, your efforts could only suspend my disappointment until the final credit role, where I was left stupefied by your collaborators.</p>

<p>In order to respect the project, I&rsquo;m trying to avoid spoiler territory, in case someone intercepts our correspondence (imagine!). But I will say that Fran Kranz&rsquo;s burnout character was so clich&eacute; (no, not in a clever &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the point&rdquo; way, sorry) and painstakingly favoured in the script that it undermined any chance the film had at finding a soul. And I won&rsquo;t even start on Richard Jenkin&rsquo;s &ldquo;dude&rdquo; dialogue that an actor half his age would still have problems choking out. It&rsquo;s what happens when you can&rsquo;t decide if you want to be a film, or be an experimental fan-fiction-masturbation about films.</p>
<p>For me, &ldquo;too much wasted effort&rdquo; was the overall theme of the film, laboring simple ideas to the point of unintelligible exhaustion. Be smart &ndash; next time someone invites you to a cabin in the woods, run.</p>
<p>With only mild creature comforts,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
