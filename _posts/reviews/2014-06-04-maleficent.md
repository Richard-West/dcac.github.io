<p>There are a lot of special effects in <em>Maleficent</em>. We&rsquo;re talking <em>Avatar</em>-levels of world building and character design. Which means you were a busy boy on set. Probably running around with a tennis ball on the end of a stick to give the actors their eyelines, and operating off-camera fans to simulate the effect of a magic spell being cast, or maybe just handing water bottles to Angelina Jolie so she didn&rsquo;t pass out from the heat of her full-body leather suit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, frankly, I&rsquo;m not all that interested in what you were doing. These blue (or green) backdrops are the reason so many behind-the-scenes featurettes are such bore now. And they&rsquo;re also the reason why the job of director has virtually become an entry-level position on a Hollywood blockbuster.</p>
<p>The producers of <a href="/letters/2014/4/4/captain-america-the-winter-soldier.html"><em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em></a> and <a href="/letters/2013/11/8/thor-the-dark-world.html"><em>Thor: The Dark World</em></a>, for example, trusted their hundred-million-dollar franchises to directors best known for their work on TV.<em> Maleficent</em>&rsquo;s director, Robert Stromberg, has never even received a directing credit before. However, he&rsquo;s worked on visual effects for nearly a hundred films, and has won Academy Awards for the Production Design on <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> and, yes, <em>Avatar.</em></p>
<p>Just think, Adam&mdash;you could be moving up the ladder much faster than you think!</p>
<p>Soon, you&rsquo;ll be the one telling actors like Sam Riley what positions to land in when he pops out of his different animal incarnations, like a crow, wolf or dragon. You&rsquo;ll get to egg-on serious actresses like Imelda Stauton and Lesley Manville to get sillier, get more cartoonish, in their roles as fairy godmothers. You might even get to witness the rare occurrence of a notorious overactor toning down his schtick (though the fact that most of Sharlto Copley&rsquo;s scenes appear to have been filmed on traditional sets may have helped ground his performance).</p>
<p>One element, however, that will most likely remain far out of your control when you become a director (in a few months or so) is the studio&rsquo;s need to emulate recent successes.</p>
<p>In this particular case, <em>Maleficent</em> is not only based on the <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> story, but seizes on the trend of telling a familiar tale from the villain&rsquo;s perspective (<em>Despicable Me,</em> <a href="/letters/2013/3/8/oz-the-great-and-powerful.html"><em>Oz the Great and Powerful</em></a>, <em>Wicked</em>). Then Disney throws in a female empowerment message that&rsquo;s recycled straight from the <a href="/letters/2013/11/28/frozen.html"><em>Frozen</em></a><em> </em>formula, which bookends just enough swordplay to draw in a male audience, &agrave; la <a href="/letters/2012/6/4/snow-white-and-the-huntsman.html"><em>Snow White and the Huntsman</em></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 97 minutes, at least it&rsquo;s mercifully short, bucking the trend of the overblown blockbusters that have to keep throwing more and more effects in our face. But this probably just means a sequel is in the works&mdash;you know, to cover whatever 15 minutes of plot they decided to leave out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But hey, a few more of these gigs and you could be in charge. Maybe I&rsquo;ll finally get the three-hour long version of <em>Aladdin</em> told from Iago&rsquo;s perspective that I&rsquo;ve always wanted.</p>
<p>Sigh,</p>
