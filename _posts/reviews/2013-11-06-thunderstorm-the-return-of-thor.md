<p><em><strong style="font-size:120%;">Dear Ray Besharah, Actor,</strong></em></p>
<p>The path taken by Grant Farrell, your character in <em>Thunderstorm: The Return of Thor</em>, is a perfect example of one of my favorite comic book myths: the completely ordinary individual who finds him/herself suddenly bestowed with fantastic powers, and their reluctant coming-to-terms with the great responsibility that comes with it all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why I enjoyed the little moments in your performance, like your character&rsquo;s barely-concealed irritation when Thor &ndash; depicted here as a vibrating, semi-transparent giant head (I&#8217;m sure we can both agree that this mockbuster&rsquo;s vision of the Norse pantheon leans more in the direction of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOROvO2fxTc">Zardoz</a> than it does to the Shakespearean majesty of Kenneth Branagh&rsquo;s <em>Thor</em>) &ndash; informs him that he is a distant blood relative of the God of Thunder, and has thus been tasked with saving the world.</p>
<p>In a movie filled with awkwardness, you&rsquo;re the only actor who feels well-suited to your role. Your performance falls somewhere in the middle of the scale, between the obviously amateur actors and the hilariously overacting semi-professionals (like the leader of the evil cult hell-bent on resurrecting the Midgard Dragon and bringing about Ragnarkok, who seems to think he&rsquo;s in the <em>Thunderstorm</em> stage adaptation).</p>
<p>You underplay things just enough to come off as an appealing, relatable everyman. I especially related to the way your character constantly looked as if he would rather be somewhere else. I&#8217;m not sure if this was a skillful demonstration of Grant Farrel&#8217;s desire to escape the improbable situation in which he has become embroiled, or your own desire to escape the improbable situation in which you were embroiled.</p>
<p>While watching <em>Thunderstorm</em>, I, too, sometimes wanted to be somewhere else. The film&rsquo;s initial amateurish charm wears off quickly; the minutes began to feel like hours. But the whole experience was made infinitely more bearable because we were in it together. And I&#8217;ll never forget that, man.</p>
<p>But I do have to ask: what did you think of your Thunderstorm costume? &nbsp;I can imagine how perplexed you must have been to find that, despite starring in a motion picture heavily reliant on Norse mythology, you would, in fact, be required to wear a rabbit-eared Iron Man suit in every action sequence. In fact, after your performance, the costume is the second-most brilliant element of the film. I can&#8217;t help but give props to how cleverly it manages to steal from two of Marvel&rsquo;s biggest comic book characters <em>simultaneously</em>. Now <em>that&rsquo;s</em> some good mockbustering.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Kelan Young.</p>
