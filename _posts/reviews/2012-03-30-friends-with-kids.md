<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><em><strong>Dear Tiffany Little Canfield</strong>, Casting Director,</em></span></p>
<p>OMG, I loved <em>Bridesmaids</em>! We <em>totally</em> have the same sense of humour. Such great casting too, didn&rsquo;t you think? Maybe this <em>Friends With Kids</em> movie you were hired to cast will finally showcase your own sharp eye for talent.  Your big break is coming, I just know it&hellip;</p>
<p>Hey, so, I just realized I never finished this postcard from, like, nine months ago. And I just saw <em>Friends With Kids, w</em>ith Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Jon Hamm, Chris O&rsquo;Dowd&hellip; look, we need to talk. I understand your first job on the <em>Sex and the City</em> movie might have confused you about your responsibilities as a casting director. And no one blames you for cutting and pasting the stage actors for the <em>Rent </em>film. But I&rsquo;m starting to think you&rsquo;re just plain lazy.</p>
<p>Did you actually do any casting here, or did you just get this big group of friends to choose roles out of a hat? Don&rsquo;t tell me you &ldquo;let&rdquo; the adorable and talented Jennifer Westfeldt star in another film she wrote and directed. Wait! Maybe it was your out-of-the-box thinking that got Megan Fox to play the self-absorbed sex pot! Do you see a pattern here?  Let me do my own bit of recycling and quote Roland Emmerich to his science advisor: who&rsquo;s the idiot that keeps hiring you?</p>
<p>I mean, the film is decent: the premise is far-fetched but funny, and the phrase &ldquo;fuck the shit out of me&rdquo; has never sounded so sweet. I just don&rsquo;t want to know what you&rsquo;re really using that couch in your office for.</p>
<p>Casting you aside,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
