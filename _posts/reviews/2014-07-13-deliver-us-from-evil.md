<p><em style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Amber Fleming-Shon,</strong> Standby Painter,</em></p>
<p>Scenic artists like you can often help good horror films stand apart from their less-than-palatable counterparts. As an audience, we know all the tricks a filmmaker uses to scare us: tense music, a vulnerable child, a cat that pops out of nowhere, etc. No shortage of those in <em>Deliver Us From Evil</em>. But your new film also straddles genres: it&rsquo;s a supernatural thriller and a gritty detective story. The horror half will win out in the marketing campaign, but for my money it&rsquo;s your work that makes this a real winner: you successfully create an atmosphere that feels like <em>Se7en</em> meets <em>The Exorcist.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too bad they had to make the villain a painter, eh?</p>
<p>Or maybe not, since it gave you the juiciest scenes to work on. Like the early zoo sequence, when NYPD Sergeant Ralph Sarchie investigates an attempted murder, and there&rsquo;s a potential witness creeping around the grounds at night. He&rsquo;s carrying a paint roller and, when about to be questioned, disappears casually into the lion&rsquo;s den (which is a nice upgrade from the aforementioned cat scare&mdash;though we get those as well, plus dogs, and rats, and fish, etc). It&rsquo;s soon revealed that our mystery man is painting, and then covering over, ancient symbols around the city that are conjuring demons.</p>
<p>Since this film is &ldquo;inspired by true accounts&rdquo;,there was probably a painter, once, who painted something weird, and then something weird happened. You wouldn&rsquo;t know anything about that though, would you?</p>
<p>Actually, don&rsquo;t answer that. The less I know, the better. Which is the same philosophy I always take with me to the movies. In this case, I only knew about the headliners: Eric Bana in the lead and &Eacute;dgar Ram&iacute;rez as an &ldquo;undercover&rdquo; Jesuit priest. Ram&iacute;rez has a lot of goodwill with me after his hypnotizing performance in <em>Carlos</em>, and I still find Bana appealing as an actor (even in his <a href="/letters/2013/8/30/closed-circuit.html">less impressive</a> work). The biggest surprise here was seeing <em>Community</em>&rsquo;s Jeff Winger, a.k.a. Joel McHale, as Bana&rsquo;s adrenaline junkie partner. He seems like the most obvious &ldquo;creative flourish&rdquo; to this apparently true story, and a rather clich&eacute;d addition to the film&rsquo;s canvas, especially with the very literal homage to <em>Se7en</em>, with each deadly sin tattooed on his neck.</p>
<p>Though director Scott Derrickson, who most recently helmed <a href="/letters/2012/10/17/sinister.html"><em>Sinister</em></a> and wrote <a href="/letters/2014/5/19/devils-knot.html"><em>Devil&rsquo;s Knot</em></a><em>,</em> is less interested in doing something new than doing something well. I can&rsquo;t fault him for that. This film does have a wonderful sense of self and scale (with all those beautiful establishing shots of New York). Beautiful, too, is the rich black cinematography and creative set design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The grungy rooms you had to paint and re-paint give the proper sense of lived-in verisimilitude. The attention to detail is extremely useful until the third act, which is essentially one long by-the-book exorcism. At that point, all the subtlety you and the rest of the filmmakers (literally) goes flying out the window.</p>
<p>Peeling off,&nbsp;</p>
