<p><em><strong style="font-size:130%;">Dear Santa,</strong></em></p>
<p>It sure has been a while. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I ever stopped believing&mdash;perhaps I just forgot. But <em>Rise of the Guardians</em> reminded me. Snow-globe portals? Baby tooth fairies? Globe-spanning rabbit holes? A <em>literal</em> dream car? It doesn&rsquo;t take much of an imagination to figure out that these elaborate attempts at explaining the impossible make<em> perfect sense</em>. You&rsquo;re Santa, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and the Sandman, the big four&mdash;of course you&rsquo;ll have some tricks up your sleeve.</p>
<p>So, when the Man in the Moon calls on you, like some lunar Bosley in <em>Charlie&rsquo;s Angels</em>, to protect the world&rsquo;s children who face imminent threat from the Boogie Man (Pitch Black for those in the know), I can&rsquo;t think of a better crew to assemble. But why didn&rsquo;t he think you could do it on your own?</p>
<p>Enter Jack Frost to help you, which I didn&rsquo;t really get. Sure people mention him in passing, but does anyone actually believe in him? I feel like his skill set and modus operandi isn&rsquo;t quite up to par with the rest of you. We do get to see the best of Jack &ndash; snow days, sledding, ice skating &ndash; but what about frostbite, figure-depriving snow suits, and flu season? I&rsquo;m just saying, he isn&rsquo;t a perfect choice. Maybe he&rsquo;s just the type of conflicted character that makes for great story telling.</p>
<p>In the end though, you believe in him, so I do too.</p>
<p>But back to your mission: protecting the kids. Throughout your assignment there&rsquo;s some laughter, some tears, and some seriously heavy questions asked. Where does Jack come from? Why is he here? And what happens if we all stop believing? Fortunately, Jack was able to answer the first two. Fortunately for us, we got a pretty good idea of the answer to the last one. Understanding the alternative, I consider your victory over Pitch Black to be a big win for the good guys.</p>
<p>Even my co-reviewer, a newly-minted 8-year-old, who, I was told &ndash; and who I believe &ndash; has recently successfully completed spy training (he was vague on the name of the agency) gives you a big thumbs up on this one. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s his way of saying thanks.</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t stop believing,</p>
<p>Jenn and Finn</p>
