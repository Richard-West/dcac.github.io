<p>I&rsquo;m not into birdwatching. I mean, sure, I get pretty excited when I spot a blue jay or robin in the backyard. But to me birding seems like a whole lot of sitting around in silence, waiting for something interesting to happen.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I just watched Ted Bezaire&rsquo;s comedy,&nbsp;<em>The Birder.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plot is as standard as the blue-breasted common grackle: a mild-mannered, zipped-up high school teacher Ron Spencer ends the school term expecting to being named as the new Head of Ornithology at a national park. However, he loses out on the position to a rival, a congenial fellow who is equal parts birder and boy-bander. After suffering the additional indignity of being kicked out of the house by his ex-wife, Ron&rsquo;s summer is effectively ruined. And so revenge plans are hatched. School janitors are recruited. Relationships are sabotaged. All the sort of stuff you don&rsquo;t have to stray far into the bush to find.</p>
<p>The pacing is off right from the start. Soft-spoken, low-key Ron, and his clumsy, quick-witted janitor-companion Ben are supposed to complement each other, but it felt like the actors just couldn&rsquo;t find a rhythm; the ensuing line-pause-reaction/line-pause-reaction becomes almost unbearable. This stilted pace ensures that punch-lines fall flat, &nbsp;obstacles remain undaunting and twists unshocking. There was no chance to build anticipation or intensity; I was waiting for a truck to drive through the pauses between one line of dialogue and the next.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, Sarah, what were you actually called upon to do? We&rsquo;re given a brief explanation of one or two birding terms, but I was expecting a film about birdwatching to include more, well,&nbsp;<em>bird stuff</em>. I feel like that should be a cardinal rule. I counted one prairie falcon, one photograph of a bird, one taxidermied fowl&mdash;and that was it (unless you somehow consulted on the artwork in the opening credits). I get the impression there were a few inside jokes, but without a clearer understanding of the subculture one can&rsquo;t fully appreciate the lampooning of it.</p>
<p>Knowing this was a low-budget, independent film that featured a lot of homegrown talent, I was really rooting for&nbsp;<em>The Birder</em>. I wanted to like it. I wanted, even if just for the briefest of moments, to be psyched about birding. Unfortunately, things just didn&rsquo;t take flight.</p>
<p>Apologies for grouse-ing,</p>
<p>Nat.&nbsp;</p>
