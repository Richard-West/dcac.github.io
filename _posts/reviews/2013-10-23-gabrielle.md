<p><em style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Robert Charlebois,</strong> Special Appearance Maker,</em></p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re no ordinary guy, regardless of what you claimed in your 1971 hit single.</p>
<p>Except &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; is a hard word to define, as we see in Louise Archambault&rsquo;s sophomore feature <em>Gabrielle</em>. For you, it probably means being humble, easy-to-please, and relatable&mdash;all despite your superstar status in la belle province. But it&rsquo;s a little more complicated for intellectually-challenged adults, like the characters in this unassuming, poignant drama. Which is why it&rsquo;s too bad you stole their thunder.</p>
<p>You see, for all the film&rsquo;s virtues, Archambault makes a critical miscalculation in how she uses you. Initially, you&rsquo;re introduced as motivation for Gabrielle (Gabrielle Marion-Rivard), Martin (Alexandre Landry), and the other members of the choral group Les Muses de Montreal. With <em>Waiting for Guffman</em> anxiety, the group of developmentally-challenged singers practice your song <em>Ordinaire</em>, alternating lines and humming the chorus together. Their goal is to perform a rendition worthy of your company; to create a collaboration that doesn&rsquo;t feel like a charity case. It&rsquo;s an easy metaphor that represents the inherent themes of the whole film. But it doesn&rsquo;t unfold quite as gracefully as it should.</p>
<p>Your eventual participation is never in question. The characters are preparing for a show which you have already agreed to attend, making rehearsals all the more important as the group hopes to avoid any potential embarrassment. But when Martin&rsquo;s mother removes him from the group in the hopes of ending his burgeoning sexual relationship with Gabrielle, the music takes a backseat.</p>
<p>This is actually where the story is at it&rsquo;s best, spurring frank discussions about contraception, independence, and morality. &nbsp;The couple finds ways to meet, mainly through the help of Gabrielle&rsquo;s sister (M&eacute;lissa D&eacute;sormeaux-Poulin), and the film does a good job of eliciting protective feelings towards them. I found myself scrutinizing every physical encounter and wrestling with my desire to see them get together and do so responsibly. It&rsquo;s a unique place to mine dramatic tension, and helps the film rise above being another simple, sappy love story.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there comes a point where the relationship is treated like just another hook-up. And I realize this might be the point, but it&rsquo;s also a melodramatic overstatement (something you&rsquo;re famous for)&mdash;much the same way your introduction is teased with a 20-second over-the-shoulder tracking shot that eventually gives up, pans around, and shows us your face.</p>
<p>Then we actually spend some time with you before the big show, which &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think is a spoiler to say &ndash; reveals you to be a bit of a spotlight hog. We get a full rendition of your biggest hit &ndash; <em>Lindberg</em> &ndash; and while I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a treat for &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; Quebecers who love the tune, it overpowers the small and extraordinary truths at the heart of the story.</p>
<p>Otherwise, really enjoyed the show.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
