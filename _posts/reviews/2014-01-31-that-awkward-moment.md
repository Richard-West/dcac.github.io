<p class="Body">You ever wonder why someone like Zac Efron has a hard time shaking his &ldquo;pretty-boy&rdquo; reputation? No? No guesses? Let me give you a hint. See there&rsquo;s a certain class of male Hollywood A-lister that decides he needs to have his very own dedicated make-up artist. Leonardo Dicaprio. Tom Cruise. Bradley Cooper. Brad Pitt. Despite not requiring any prostheses or aging effects (to look older, anyway), in 2013 these men refused to risk the acting trailer&rsquo;s roulette make-up chair. Some of them have earned that luxury, I suppose. &ldquo;Mr. Efron&rdquo; has not. But the fact he still hired you for a performance that&rsquo;s trying to make him seem like &ldquo;just one of the guys&rdquo; crystallizes everything that&rsquo;s wrong with <em>That Awkward Moment</em>.</p>
<p class="Body">Let me explain.</p>
<p class="Body">For most men, imperfections are what endear to our onscreen heroes: Bill Murray&rsquo;s pockmarks, Bruce Willis&rsquo; hairline, Christian Bale&rsquo;s eye wart (warning: if you haven&rsquo;t noticed that one yet, it henceforth can ever be unseen). This un-airbrushed reality acts like a subliminal reassurance that our boyish crushes are based purely on strength of character. We&rsquo;re shallow and insecure creatures, after all, and wouldn&rsquo;t want our affections to be mistaken for anything other than platonic. So in a movie about an extreme three-way bromance, these types of insights matter. We don&rsquo;t have a friend like Zac Efron, and we don&rsquo;t want a friend like Zac Efron. Miles Teller? Maybe. Michael B. Jordan? We should be so lucky.</p>
<p class="Body">And no, I&rsquo;m no longer talking about looks.</p>
<p class="Body">It&rsquo;s not fair to conflate characters and performers, but a romantic comedy like this isn&rsquo;t asking anyone to &ldquo;act&rdquo; so much as &ldquo;do your thing&rdquo;. So Jason (Efron) is a witless womanizer and impossibly good looking. Daniel (Teller) is a wise-cracking wingman and professional sidekick. Mikey (Jordan) is accomplished, easy-going and earnest. They all dress extremely well, live in beautiful brick lofts and do their best to play a male <em>Sex in the City</em> trio. Then, upon Mikey&rsquo;s wife leaving him, they make a bros-before-hoes pact that Efron&rsquo;s character unreasonably treats like a holy covenant. Everything that happens next is an embarrassingly lazy one-conversation-would-clear-everything-up &ldquo;drama&rdquo;, spaced between some comedic set pieces. Including a toilet scene. The real reason you were hired, I presume.</p>
<p class="Body">Which makes me think: maybe we men shouldn&rsquo;t be so harsh on Efron. I mean, like DiCaprio in <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em>, Efron really &ldquo;put himself out there&rdquo; in this film, giving a &ldquo;brave&rdquo; ass-featuring fully nude profile shot (sans candle). I couldn&rsquo;t look long, lest I compromise my fragile heterosexuality, but even at a glance this chiseled Adonis was glistening to perfection. Yes, despite the fact he was trying to hide a Viagra-induced erection in toilet. So what&rsquo;s my beef, you ask? Only that instead of the moment being truly self-deprecating, funny and/or vulnerable, Efron turned the scene into what&rsquo;s bound to be the most downloaded screensaver of the year. Unlike his <em>High School Musical</em> co-star and former fling Vanessa Hudgens, Efron&rsquo;s just not ready go <a href="/letters/2013/3/28/spring-breakers.html"><span class="Hyperlink0">Spring Breakers</span></a> on his perfect Disney persona yet.&nbsp; And this is after getting <a href="/letters/2012/10/26/the-paperboy.html"><span class="Hyperlink1">urinated on by Nicole Kidman</span></a> last year.</p>
<p class="Body">No, I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s just no saving the boy. Or his movies.</p>
