<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><strong><em>Dear Carrie Johnson,</em></strong><em> Unit Nurse,</em></span></p>
<p>The day leading up to seeing <em>RED 2</em> was a little rough for me. As the day went on, I realized I was coming down with something. It started with a scratchy throat; then&nbsp; some general achiness. By the time I was heading out to the show, my eyes felt so tired, the notion of watching a movie started to feel like too much effort.</p>
<p>So, first things first: do you know what I might have come down with? Are there any treatments? Should I see someone?</p>
<p>Anyway, where were we? Right, <em>RED 2.</em> I can see why this film needed a unit nurse on it. An action movie with this many stunts and pyrotechnics certainly has ample opportunity for on-set injuries - I mean that in the best sense possible. One of the best things about <em>RED 2 </em>is its old fashioned approach to on-screen action. The &lsquo;old&rsquo; may only go as far back as the 1980s, but that&rsquo;s okay, since that&rsquo;s most of <em>RED 2</em>&rsquo;s stars had their heydays. And while the movie deals with the inability to ever escape your past, it also (very marginally) deals with growing older. And with a cast that in large part resembles a retirement home, it couldn&rsquo;t have hurt to have a full-time nurse on standby.</p>
<p>Bruce Willis and John Malkovich reprise their roles as ex-black ops agents (RED being an acronym for &ldquo;Retired, Extremely dangerous&rdquo;), forced back into action when they are framed as the instigators in a plot to detonate an ultra-powerful atomic device for, and end up targeted for the kind of retirement that doesn&rsquo;t involve rounds of golf or trips to COSTCO. Helen Mirren, Mary Louise Parker, and&nbsp; Catherine Zeta Jones&nbsp; are along for the ride as, in order, An ex-MI6 operative, Willis&rsquo;s current flame, and Willis&rsquo;s former flame (and KGB femme fatal, naturally). As a group, these actors area lot of fun &ndash; not as much fun as the movie thinks they are, but fun nonetheless.</p>
<p>Which is a relief. After this year&rsquo;s dismal <em><a href="/letters/2013/2/15/a-good-day-to-die-hard.html">A Good Day to Die Hard</a></em>, it&rsquo;s nice to see Willis in a somewhat competent action film. Instead of relying on gimmicky &ndash; <a href="letters/2012/8/10/the-bourne-legacy.html">and</a> <a href="/letters/2013/6/19/world-war-z.html">trendy</a> &ndash; shaky cam cinematography, director Dean Parisot actually seems interested in crafting scenes that make sense spatially and physically. To a point at least. As <em>RED 2 </em>&nbsp;goes along, it becomes more interested in making its cast look cool. Which is a problem.</p>
<p>I was game to hop along for the bumpy ride, even if I didn&rsquo;t think everything was clicking. I didn&rsquo;t even mind the liberal borrowing from other, better films (among the films that it lifted from, I noted <em>Charade, The Bourne Identity, The Matrix,</em> and<em> Mission: Impossible: Ghost Protocol</em>), but things started to creak like joints that haven&rsquo;t been used in a long time. To remedy this, instead of following the advice you might give, to ease into things, use slow, steady progress until you&rsquo;re ready to run again, <em>RED 2</em> starts to flail like an over-the-hill jock trying to reclaim his glory with no warm up. By the time Willis and pals are shooting up an embassy in a scene that not only adds nothing to the story, but also has our main characters mowing down what seem to be (from what I could tell) innocent guards doing their job, I was ready to check myself out. That there was 20 minutes left only made things worse. I felt like a patient in the ER&nbsp; with a recurring injury; I know what&rsquo;s wrong, I know what the diagnosis will be, but I still have to wait for the on-call doctor to see me so that I can leave.</p>
<p>But to my original point, should I get this flu checked out?</p>
<p>Wishing you had triaged the script,</p>
<p>Casey</p>
