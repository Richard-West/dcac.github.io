<p>From the very opening frames of <em>Iron Man 3</em>, anyone familiar with your work will recognize it as a Shane Black film: the staccato stream-of-consciousness voice-over, the trilling notes of a goofy pop song played for laughs. This sort of quick recognition is pretty impressive, considering you&rsquo;ve only directed one other movie (the self-referential neo-noir flick <em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</em>). Impressive, too, that you managed to retain a bit of your idiosyncratic style in what is perhaps the most constraining situation imaginable: a studio-financed franchise worth mega-millions.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s most astounding, however, is how you managed to turn the third chapter in one of the most popular modern comic book adaptations into another loving ode to <em>film noir</em>.</p>
<p><em>Kiss Kiss</em> was the beginning of Robert Downey Jr.&rsquo;s Hollywood redemption tour (his character Harry Lockhart was Tony Stark with training wheels; all the charm and ego, none of the money), and it&rsquo;s a wonderful bit of kismet that you guys are reunited, here, with the vast resources of Marvel Studios and Paramount Pictures behind you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how do you indulge? You keep Tony Stark outside the Iron Man armor for most of the movie, treating him instead like an good <em>noir</em> foil: a man betrayed by his own hubris, whose greed and misanthropy come back to bite him in the ass. After a series of attacks wrought by Ben Kingsley&rsquo;s implacable super-terrorist The Mandarin, Stark follows clues like a good private dick, escaping from trouble <em>not</em> through the use of brute force, but rather by a bullet-headed persistence and a good deal of blind luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>noir</em> hero is rarely invincible or infallible; the private eyes and aging boxers and struggling conmen who populate the genre are hardly ever in control, and neither, in this film, is Tony Stark. He&rsquo;s struggling with post-traumatic stress after the interdimensional shenanigans in the last act of <em>The Avengers,</em> and suffers constant anxiety attacks that threaten his most precious resource: his ego.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult in a movie beholden to the rhythms of a modern Hollwyood blockbuster to earn a genuine surprise; we&rsquo;re all so familiar with the conventions that even when they&rsquo;re broken it feels expected. However, the turn that the plot takes with The Mandarin feels genuinely refreshing (and finding something refreshing within genre orthodoxy is kind of your specialty: more proof that this is, through and through, a Shane Black joint).</p>
<p>The secret of the Iron Man movies has been that they&rsquo;ve managed to avoid the crippling self-seriousness that drags so many current comic book adaptations to the bottom of the ol&rsquo; Nietzschian muddy waters (I&rsquo;m looking at you, <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em>). And that&rsquo;s why you were such an obvious choice to make this movie. You may not have invented the action-comedy, but you were certainly a founding father of its tropes and traditions. <em>Lethal Weapon</em> may have aged poorly, but that&rsquo;s only because it&rsquo;s the foundational text from which the prevailing common language has sprung.</p>
<p>But here we are talking semantics and thematics. A Shane Black movie, above all else, is entertainment. And <em>Iron Man 3</em> is nothing if not entertaining (says the guy who has <a href="/letters/2012/5/10/the-avengers.html">trouble remaining objective</a><span style="text-decoration:underline;">)</span>. And not simply entertaining in the traditional manner of CGI-fueled summer popcorn fare. The way you confound expectations by setting up heroic moments for Stark and then letting them sputter to a stop feels subversive, somehow, and even though we get the whiz-bang finale where the hero and villain (Guy Pearce going full Alan Rickman) find themselves face-to-face and fist-to-fist atop a tower, the self-awareness that runs beneath it (&ldquo;Here we are, on the roof,&rdquo; Pearce says) makes it feel like it&rsquo;s all on purpose.</p>
<p>And though <em>film noir</em> is defined by a moral ambiguity and bleakness which <em>Iron Man 3</em> certainly lacks, it is always driven forward, as the gears turn and the latches click into place, by a sense of inevitability, a feeling, indeed, that it&rsquo;s all happening on purpose. And that, I think, is where much of the joy of a Shane Black movie comes from.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
