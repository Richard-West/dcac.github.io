<p>So here we are, seven years after the release of <em>Hercules in New York.</em> It looks like the, shall we say, <a href="/content/2012/11/6/hercules-in-new-york.html">&ldquo;interesting&rdquo; way that film turned</a> out forced you to rethink your Hollywood career trajectory. Instead of rushing headlong into leading roles, it seems you dialed it back and looked for roles that were not only a good fit, but also provided the opportunity to work with some big name directors. Roles that required more than just your Mr. Universe credentials.</p>
<p>First, and maybe due to your experience being overdubbed in <em>Hercules, </em>you took a very minor and speechless part in Robert Altman&rsquo;s classic neo-noir <em>The Long Goodbye</em>. Sure, the uncredited role of &ldquo;Hood in Augustine&#8217;s Office&rdquo; probably didn&rsquo;t turn any casting agent heads, but working with the hot, post-<em>MASH,</em> post-<em>McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller</em> Altman must have been its own reward. This was the 70s, after all, and directors were Hollywood&rsquo;s new stars. If nothing else, it had to have been a master class on the new way to make films.</p>
<p>After that, we come to <em>Stay Hungry.</em></p>
<p>Working with Bob Rafelson must have been a similar no-brainer. And you even got a speaking role to boot&mdash;the first in your own voice. Best known for the classic <em>Five Easy Pieces</em>, Rafelson was another director with a knack for showcasing actors in his decidedly character-driven stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, <em>Stay Hungry </em>operates almost as a <em>Five Easy Pieces</em> in reverse. Where Jack Nicholson&rsquo;s Robert Dupea returns to his family&rsquo;s wealthy estate after abandoning it for the blue collar world, <em>Stay Hungry</em>&rsquo;s Jeff Bridges flees his business and societal obligations to become part of a new culture. Gym culture, to be precise. Your culture.</p>
<p>Of course this is where you slide so naturally into the picture, and why it plays like such a smart career move on your part. No longer saddled with the terrible, ridiculous dialogue required of a Greek demi-god, you&rsquo;re able to give a relaxed, and charismatic performance as Joe Santo &mdash; the Austrian-born, aspiring Mr. Universe (you still were at the career stage where your accent had to be explained). Along with the impressive body-building, though, Santo is also versed in literature, plays a mean fiddle, and is referred to as the curling champion of Austria. If you weren&rsquo;t already aiming to be titled &ldquo;Mr. Universe,&rdquo; you would have had to settle for &ldquo;Superman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If only the rest of <em>Stay Hungry</em> had the same easy charm you provide as Santo. While it does boast a number of acutely-observed scenes and performances&mdash;Bridge&rsquo;s and Sally Fields&rsquo; relationship comes immediately to mind&mdash;the film suffers from a schizophrenia, as it can&rsquo;t decide whether it&rsquo;s a character study or an exploitation film about body-building. But really, any film that climaxes by intercutting between you, wearing only a speedo, running to the rescue, and another 15 similarly dressed bodybuilders storming the streets and then holding an impromptu pose-off, can&rsquo;t be all bad, can it?</p>
<p>Just more bad than I wanted it to be.</p>
<p>Flexingly yours,&nbsp;</p>
