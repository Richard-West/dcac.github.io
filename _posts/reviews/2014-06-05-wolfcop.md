<p><em style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Peter La Rocque</strong>, Cinematographer,</span></em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been waiting with keen interest for <em>Wolfcop</em> since I first saw the trailer on <a href="https://www.cinecoup.com/cc/canada-2013">Cinecoup</a> way back in early 2013. It ranked solidly in my Top 10 to make it to the end of the competition, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to see it finally come to life, and even more excited to see <em>Wolfcop 2</em> already in the works! The entire cast and crew, along with the Cinecoup team, deserves accolades for bringing the next Great Canadian Horror Comedy Cult Classic to the screen.</p>
<p>That being said, let&#8217;s get down to the business at hand. I&#8217;m not a cinematographer, so I may be out of line, but what was up with all those close-ups? It felt a bit overdone. I&rsquo;m sure you and writer/director Lowell Dean had a plan, a well thought-through shot list, and maybe you were trying to hit a number of &#8220;must haves&#8221;&mdash;but at times it felt like I was watching a soap opera. This sort of thing doesn&rsquo;t usually bother me much, but it happened frequently enough that it stuck out just as much as the funny bits.</p>
<p>Luckily, this wasn&#8217;t a major distraction. Simply put: you had me at&#8230;<em>Wolfcop</em>.</p>
<p>The premise is simple and effective. Woodhaven&#8217;s soon-to-be-fanged cop is a sloppy, small-town drunk, who will never make the cop-of-the-month club (and doesn&#8217;t aspire to either). One night, on the prowl to break up some shenanigans, he gets clocked in the noggin and winds up in a bad way. The next day, the advent of a hairier and more smell-sensitive persona coincides with the town&#8217;s drunk hunting festival (yes, drunk hunting is <em>always</em> a good idea). With some nefarious supernatural forces at play, and the gumption to fight the town&#8217;s corrupt underbelly, our hero partakes in some crazy man-wolf transformations <em>and</em> finds the time to make sweet, sweet love to his lady-friend by moonlight. A wolfcop&#8217;s job is never done, or so it would seem.</p>
<p>I found myself laughing out-loud several times, as there&#8217;s a lot to like in all that fuzz. The fact is, if the story and the characters weren&#8217;t so crazy, it wouldn&#8217;t work so well.</p>
<p>Where it falls flat, as I&#8217;ve mentioned, is with the camerawork. I noticed that this is your first feature as cinematographer. While that&rsquo;s an achievement to be proud of, even the independent horror-comedy scene in Canada has a certain baseline quality of the craft. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll take what you&#8217;ve learned making <em>Wolfcop</em> with you to your next gig, and, I&rsquo;ll accept as an excuse that a movie featuring an exploding penis is perhaps not looking to win any artistic merit awards (well, maybe something in the special visual effects department). In my books, a movie like this just wants to entertain the masses, and I was entertained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that you, Lowell, and the rest of the crew come back together for <em>Wolfcop 2,</em> and that you bring with you the lessons from making this first flick together. It&#8217;s definitely an achievement to be proud of.</p>
<p>Cheers to a new Canadian Classic!</p>
