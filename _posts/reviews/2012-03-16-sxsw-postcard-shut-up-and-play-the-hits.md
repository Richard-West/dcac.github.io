<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><em><strong>Dear Spike Jonze,</strong> camera operator,</em></span></p>
<p>Are times tough? No, don&rsquo;t think so. But I think I know why you took this seemingly beneath you gig for the concert film <em>Shut Up and Play the Hits&mdash;</em>to have a first-class view of a concert destined to go down as a classic.</p>
<p>Well, I hope you enjoyed it. Being LCD Soundsystem&rsquo;s last performance ever, it sure seemed&mdash;and sounded&mdash;pretty great. And the footage you and your co-cameramen got was surprisingly intimate, considering the huge crowd filling out Madison Square Gardens. Or so I assume; shots conveying the full scale of the show, both on stage and off, were strangely lacking.</p>
<p>Were you involved in the footage shot the next day, following frontman James Murphy around New York as he tried to decide on the next chapter of his life? I&rsquo;m guessing no &ndash; these had a staginess and pretension that even your craziest fictional films avoid.</p>
<p>But man, that show rocked.</p>
<p>Yours in disco infiltration,</p>
<p>Casey</p>
