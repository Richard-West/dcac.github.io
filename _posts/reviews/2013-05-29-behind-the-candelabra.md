<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><em><strong>Dear Greg Fusak</strong>, Best Boy,</em></span></p>
<p>Liberace was, by all accounts, a fabulous man. <em>Fab-u-lous</em>. A stage diva of the highest order; an incredibly gifted pianist, an absurdly lavish dresser, and a proudly flamboyant performer. For a period, he was also the world&rsquo;s highest paid entertainer. But like the subjects of all great American tragedies, that wasn&rsquo;t enough. He was missing something. A lover. A friend. A son. All of which he found in Scott Thornson &ndash; a simple Massachusetts&rsquo;s animal lover who became the &ldquo;best boy&rdquo; to the brightest lightshow in the Vegas.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m talking about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the outside world, &ldquo;best boy&rdquo; is a pretty funny title. Not unlike the &ldquo;best man&rdquo; at a wedding, the description of &ldquo;best&rdquo; is actually second to one other. In your case, it&rsquo;s the second-in-command of the lighting department, the person in charge of coordinating people and schedules. A similar relationship, in some ways, that Scott has with Liberace. And for both of you, I imagine it&rsquo;s sometimes hard never being in the spotlight &ndash; especially when you&rsquo;re always so close to the stage.</p>
<p>Matt Damon, looking more boyish at age 42 than he ever has, plays the doe-eyed Scott who meets Liberace (a fab-u-lous Michael Douglas) backstage at a Vegas show in 1977. From there, an unconventional relationship blossoms outside the prying eyes of a deeply homophobic world. They&rsquo;re also contending with a major age difference, and a confusing professional relationship &ndash; Scott being bisexual and Liberace being sexually demanding. But the actors do a great job of stripping away the extravagance and focusing on the simple, relatable experience of people initially swooning over one another and then growing apart. Just with a lot more drugs and plastic surgery.</p>
<p>This is a film that Hollywood studios believed couldn&rsquo;t find a theatrical audience and was therefore produced for television by HBO, after premiering at Cannes. Such a grand stage seems befitting of the man who inspired the film, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d agree. Even if Steven Soderberg&rsquo;s staid direction never indulges in all of the lightshow around the candelabra the way I&rsquo;m sure you would have liked.&nbsp; Instead he&rsquo;s more interested in the shadows and quiet nooks of the story.</p>
<p>Was it the best approach? Maybe not, but then again, that depends on your definition of best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
