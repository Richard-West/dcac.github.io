**Dear 2012 Winners of a Silver Stamp,**

There's no shortage of awards out there. The end of every year means best actor, best director and best film accolades will be piling up on the mantels of stars. But our mandate at Dear Cast and Crew is to acknowledge the work of everyone who helps make a movie possible. We're therefore doing our part to look back on 2012 and recognize the work that made us stand up and take notice. You, brave soldiers, have earned Dear Cast and Crew's Silver Stamp of approval for your most excellent contributions to the art and discourse of cinema.
