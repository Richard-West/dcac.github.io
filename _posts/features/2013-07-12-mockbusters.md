They say everything is a remix. And nowhere is that more true than in Hollywood, where remakes and reimagnings are *de rigeur*. But sometimes a remix is nothing more than a rip-off. Behold, the _Mockbuster_!

Produced on a barely-there budget, populated by has-beens and never-wills, these flicks appear months before their blockbuster counterparts to piggyback on studio marketing dollars and scam a few accidental downloads. But are they works of art? Welcome to Dear Cast and Crew’s **Mockbusters** **Series**.
