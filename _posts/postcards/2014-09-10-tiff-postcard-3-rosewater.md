So you didn't land the world premiere of _Rosewater_. Not even the North American premiere, actually. So what if the story is about an Iranian-Canadian journalist. And big deal that everyone is curious about what Jon Stewart brings to his first film as writer and director.

This is _not_ a super sarcastic set-up from _The Daily Show_ (those can be extremely dangerous, after all). After seeing the picture, there's no sense losing sleep over the fact that you made us thesecond (gasp!) audience to see this film.

It won't be hard for journalists to get excited about the tale of Mazir Bahari. The film does a great job of lauding the dangerous risks that the press faces abroad. Especially since the film does so without ever becoming saccharine or sanctimonious. On the other hand, there isn't enough going on at a plot level to warrant such a big production (a good metaphor for the Bahari's imprisonment, actually). Because footage from _The Daily Show_ was used to accuse Bahari of being a U.S. spy, I understand why Stewart felt a need to make the film. I'm just not sure many other's will feel the need to see itâ€”especially once the novelty wares off.
