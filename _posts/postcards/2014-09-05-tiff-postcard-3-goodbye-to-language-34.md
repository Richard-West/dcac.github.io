If you're gonna play a new Jean-Luc Godard film, darn tootin' I'm gonna sit through it.

At age 83, The master French provocateur has not slowed down nor sanded the edges off of his aggressively experimental cinema. I quite willingly embarked on the 70 minute masochism that is _Goodbye to Language 3D_. The mischief this time includes an assaultive sound design that punched new holes in my ears and splitting the dual camera system required for native 3D to create double exposure images that effectively raped my retinas. Not to mention the philosophical debates between a naked man and woman while they were expelling a case of the runs (which at least meant the fart sounds were coming from within the film, for once ). There were also some gem lines of spastic voiceover dialogue, saying how "Images are the murder of the present", and how "soon everyone will need an interpreter to understand the words coming out of their own mouth". Only Godard could make these statements ring so true.
