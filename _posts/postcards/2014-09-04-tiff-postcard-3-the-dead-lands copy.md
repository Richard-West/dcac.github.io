The first ever film in the Maori language? And it’s all about Maori warriors?

Sign me up!

This film was getting some nice buzz before the festival, largely because it was singled out by your head programmer, Cameron Bailey, as one to watch. But does it elevate itself past the novelty factor of a Kiwi beefcake action film? Not really. But it doesn't disappoint, either. The (many) fight scenes aren't always well framed, but it's satisfyingly bloody and often eye-opening (watching a Maori warrior take a shit on the skull of his ancestor will have that effect). All the macho posturing before battle – the literal tongue-wagging – worked for me, and represents the kind of fare you showcase so well: audience-friendly films that might otherwise get lost in the shuffle.
