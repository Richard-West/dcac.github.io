Few documentaries warrant a sequel. Then again, few documentaries are landmark cinematic achievements like _The Act of Killing_.

Joshua Oppenheimer's new film, _The Look of Silence_, once against takes us into the dark and disgraceful period of Indonesian history, face-to-face with the genocidal madmen who still hold political power 40 years after their crimes.

Living up to _The Act of Killing_'s innovative and subversive storytelling tactics might not be possible, but _The Look of Silence_ breaks new ground by actually confronting the killers about their crimes. Once again risking his life, along with dozens of others who helped make the film (as before, many are [credited as "Anonymous"](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/9/13/the-act-of-killing.html)), Oppenheimer gives us a brave central character to get behind: Adi, a man whose brother was brutally slaughtered by the paramilitary death squads.It's as shocking and provocative as its predecessor, while still standing alone as an artistic and activist triumph.
