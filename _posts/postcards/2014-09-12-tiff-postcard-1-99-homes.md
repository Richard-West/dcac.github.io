Your line-up this year might have some problems, but _99 Homes_ ain't one.

Writer/director Ramin Bahari steps out of indie obscurity to create a pointed and poignant look at the U.S. housing crash. Andrew Garfield and Michael Shannon face-off in this realistic drama about how the rich get richer, and the poor get fucked. Small details, like Garfield's overgrown hair and Shannon's smart (but not slick) manipulating ground the film rather than making it feel like it's simply capitalizing on a cautionary tale du jour. It's this year's _Margin Call_, but with a better chance at breaking through to a wider audience.

_99 Homes_ is essentially a horror film for home-owners. Only the ghosts are real, and they come knocking on your door with foreclosure orders.
