Susanne Bier's _A Second Chance_ was perhaps a bleak choice to kick off my TIFF 2014 selections, but it set the bar pretty high. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau plays a policeman who does something drastic and inadvisable when tragedy strikes at home. Though my viewing companion was desperate for even a few moments of levity, I was waiting for the film to veer off into overwrought melodrama which, thankfully, it didn't.

Any story centered upon the endangerment or harming of children elicits an intensely visceral response, with little room or patience for nuance. Care is taken to present the character's actions while underscoring their vulnerabilities, commanding compassion from the viewer rather than revulsion. Full credit goes to Bier for the restraint and sensitivity with which she treats the subject and her characters.
