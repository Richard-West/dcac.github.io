I usually avoid your Gala Presentations line-up. It's stellar programming, but I know I'll eventually get to see most of those films in theatres, and I'd rather save my money for selections I'll probably never get another chance to see. I made an exception for Cédric Jimenez's _The Connection_, the French remake of _The French Connection_, and I'm kicking myself for not attending the actual premiere. Stargazing isn't really my cup of tea, but I'd watch Jean Dujardin shell pistachios in silence for two hours and still consider it the most compelling thing I'd seen all year. Seriously, the man might have the most hard-working eyebrows in contemporary cinema. They are a supporting role unto themselves. So, just this once, I may not have minded the shrieking throngs on the red carpet.

Dujardin and Gilles Lellouche both deliver excellent performances as, respectively, a powerful drug lord and the magistrate appointed to go after him. Set in 1970s Marseille, the film is slick and stylish on all fronts (questionable sideburns on all male actors notwithstanding), with a killer soundtrack and an gripping plot that garnered some of the most enthusiastic audience response I witnessed at the festival this year's festival.

PS. I have but one complaint; the most memorable part of the original _French Connection_ was the chase sequence. You know the one. _That_ chase sequence. Jimenez passes on recreating or refashioning the sequence in his version, and after waiting for it on tenterhooks, I felt a bit let down.
