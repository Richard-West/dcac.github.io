I'm so so so sorry. I don't know what happened to me. Well, yes I do. I was rushing into the screening - pulled pork sandwich dripping in-hand - because I didn't want to miss a moment. Good thing, too, because the visual treats in Sunshine Superman come fast and early. You couldn't ask for a more visual subject than a documentary about the first BASE jumpers. Especially one that follows Carl, and accomplished director of (free-fall) photography.

So as I sat there being consumed by the story, I also had to wolf down some lunch. Quickly, too, so I could capture some quotes from these odd balls in the late 70s who parachuted off cliffs and buildings. And as the story reached it's ominous ending, I couldn't dare leave. Which is why, in the film's most dramatic and extended silent pause, I accidentally let one rip. Hard.

It's not in my head. People turned around three rows away.

So yes, I'm coming clean. If someone complains that the screening stunk, it wasn't the film. It was me.

Really sorry.
