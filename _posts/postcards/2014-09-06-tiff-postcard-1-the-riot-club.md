<p>Hot British bad boys certainly have (maybe not-so-niche) appeal. Even I was curious what  director Lone Scherfig would, as a woman, bring to <em>The Riot Club</em>, adapted by Laura Wade’s from of her own male-centric play, <em>Posh</em>. And after the opening scene, which dives head-first into big breasts and unrepentant Renaissance debauchery through a wily sense of humour, I buckled up for a wild ride.</p>

<p>Too bad the film never really went there. Despite this early filmic treatment and <em>Wolf of Wall Street</em>-esque promise, the film doesn’t amount to much more than <em>The Skulls</em> at Oxford. The play’s spatial limitation start to feel unnecessarily confined for the big screen during the climax (especially in the massive Princess of Whales Theatre, which signalled a certain importance for a press-only screening). But alas, it was all ultimately as disposable as the women the male characters talk about but rarely engage. To re-quote the them, I suppose there are films for today, and films for tomorrow.  This was just a film for today.</p>
