I love you for showcasing films like this.  
  
  
Sometimes I get jealous because Xavier Dolan is only 25, and already has 5 feature films to his name (all of which have been at TIFF). It makes me question what I've been doing with my life so far, but at the same time, he also makes me incredibly proud to be Canadian.  
  
  
Dolan is brilliant because he does not try to imitate Hollywood, or try to tell traditional 3-act stories. Instead, he creates worlds that are slightly different than our own, then sets very real, three-dimensional characters within them to see what will happen.  
  
  
I can hardly wait to see what kind of work he'll be doing in ten years' time.  

**Sincerely,**
