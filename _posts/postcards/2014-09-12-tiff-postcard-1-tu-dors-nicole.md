A dead-pan comedy from Quebec? I never thought I'd see the day.

Having programmed so many films from La Belle Province over the years, you know Quebeckers tend to like their humour a little… broad. Big comedy franchises like _Les Boys_ and _Elvis Gratton_ are obvious examples, as are the annual _Bye Bye_ New Year broadcasts, and omnipresent _Just For Laughs_ television specials. It seems like an inordinate amount of Quebec humour comes from banana peels. Then someone like Stéphane Lafleur comes along and breaks all the rules.

_Tu dors Nicole_ is framed and paced like a socially detached black-and-white art-house film following the circuitous summer days of two small town girls. But hints of surrealism tip off the audience to the comic absurdity. This feels like the first Echo X film, but made for a generation who is still too young to have found its own voice. Although this is pretty a darn good start.
