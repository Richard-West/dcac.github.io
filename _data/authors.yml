  bio: 'Growing up in California involves high-dosage film-watching. In suburban towns with nothing to do, that goes double. Opening night for Pulp Fiction meant that fifteen people showed up and all but three walked out. “It was just so profane.” Living in Europe has even different demands: when you don’t know what to do with your life, the only things left to rent on a Friday night, alone, are the films of Tarkovsky or Russ Meyer. With a bottle of wine, that’s some good cultural learnin’. Despite his experiences, Cory knows nothing about movies.'
