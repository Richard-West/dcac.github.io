I’m talking about the announcers, the color commentators, the play-by-play men. The guys who describe, in the most melodramatic, bombastic manner possible, exactly what is happening right in front of your eyes. The drama of sports can be measured in two equal parts: the sudden occurrence of something unexpected, and how that unexpected moment is called. Watch the 1980 Olympic hockey semi-finals or George Foreman’s surprise knockdown of Joe Frazier with the audio turned off; it’s certainly a different experience. Perhaps no less significant, athletically, but palpably less thrilling. Al Michaels made a career out of his incredulous rhetorical question, and Howard Cosell’s breathless bellowing has probably been recorded on a wax disc sent into deep space as a message of our cultural complexity to alien civilizations. What I’m saying is: play-by-play is important. It has much the same role in sports broadcasting as a musical score does in film: to amplify, emotionally, the action taking place on screen. And so, in a way, the play-by-play in a film is doubly important: it scores a scene, but mustn’t obscure the emotion; it describes the action, but mustn’t subvert it. And that, Bryan, is where you come in. I’m curious to know what you thought of the script when you saw it. Because Warrior is an interesting specimen. At times it follows by rote the classic framework of an underdog sports story (the training montages, the fighting-through-the-tournament montages, the supporting characters gathered around televisions montages), and, at others, casts them aside completely (the opening ten minutes is a restrained, intense conversation that seems like something lifted from one of Mike Leigh’s darker efforts). In telling the tale of two pugilistic brothers and their reformed-alcoholic father, the movie takes unabashed pride in its grittiness and realism – how else to explain the way the camera, in jittery close-up, lingers adoringly over every crag and fissure of Nolte’s face – yet moves, in its third act, to Atlantic City, where our down-to-earth trio, until now seen only jogging the concrete-gray streets of Philadelphia or teaching physics in beige suburban classrooms, are drawn into a neon-bright international gladiator tournament that seems a contrivance worthy of a Bruce Lee movie. It’s here, as the action builds to the implausible, inevitable, ineffable confrontation, that Warrior feels in danger of slipping into absurdity. At any moment, a false note threatens to collapse the carefully crafted mood. This is where you showed up, Bryan, and I think you deserve a little credit for keeping the things on the up-and-up. I totally recognized you right away.  You had some pretty memorable cameos in Old School and The Hangover, and I’ll admit, under duress, to being an aficionado of MadTV when it first arrived on the scene as the profane, frat-boy younger sibling of Saturday Night Live and alt-nerdy Kids in the Hall. In the credits, you’re listed as playing yourself, but you’re playing yourself as a fight broadcaster, and I wonder if that made the performance more difficult for you, particularly since you don’t seem to have any experience in sports broadcasting. But, like the best play-by-play men, you (alongside author Sam Sheridan) call the fights with just the right mix of sympathy and self-consciousness, which captures perfectly the bravado and boyish enthusiasm inherent in MMA culture. I’ve read other reviewers complain about your hyperactive, hyperbolic commentary—but I think that’s precisely what makes it work. As a sport still in its infancy, MMA broadcasts are in their infancy, too, and despite the massive numbers UFC events pull in on pay-per-view, they lack the polish that most networks bring to big sporting events. Think about it: there are no legacy broadcasters. No Costas’ or Bermans’ or Ron MacLeans’. Who are you supposed to emulate? Joe Rogan? Nonetheless, you’re able to capture that intangible quality of cockiness that is so often used as mortar to fill in the seams of not quite knowing everything. Hyperbole is the whole point. Editorializing is the whole point. You don’t know what these two brothers have been through, but we (the audience) do, and this secret-sharing amplifies our affection for them. Warrior isn’t necessarily a film that seeks to immerse the viewer in the experience of being a fighter inside the ring – the camera often hovers at a remove on the far side of the chain-link cage – but it does strive to keep things real. Real brothers with real problems. And you, my friend, kept it realer than most.

You were doing so well, that, in the excitement, you forgot yourself­—and your place. You tried to improve on the source material by adding some gay, taking out a lady, and relying on a metaphor that brought the whole thing down around your ears. What happened? You had Bridget and Tomas with you this time. So perhaps it’s their fault, but I don’t believe it. I thought “It’s that goat movie all over again. Peter had a weird and great story and he let it slip through his fingers.” But your instincts are strong, and Bridget and Tomas are great, so I really want to understand completely. So much was right. You had, in many ways, really chosen the best path. It’s a brilliant adaptation that slims down a book and a TV series into an economical and deliciously atmospheric film, with rough blankets of paranoia and flattering quilts of intelligence. But you still pooped the bed.  I can only imagine what it was like. In the Huffington Post, you admitted that you were scared, and I believe you. When working on a screenplay as complicated and nuanced as this, you should have clung to your source material for dear life. Is it possible, that having some so close to perfection, flushed with pride, that you let yourself blow right past the whole point of your movie? So I should be clear. What exactly did you add? Well, you added some homosexuality. Maybe you thought it makes Guillam’s sacrifice more epic. Perhaps it makes Smiley more insightful for noticing it. Maybe you thought it more honest having a gay character. But doing so, you unintentionally make one of your main characters a complete bounder. Now this top spy has neither the smarts to hide his relationship from idiots like Alleline nor the courage or love to defend it when it conflicts with his workplace ambitions? And then he cries about it? It’s a flourish that pretends every one of these players hasn’t already sacrificed every single secret of theirs worth knowing. See? Just one little addition and the whole beautiful thing starts to stink. The next addition was actually a removal: Anne. In the book and series, Anne is overwhelming, Smiley’s one weakness, the one he can’t escape. She produces sound and light and noise and humiliation that keeps him from clearly seeing the truth. I could even forgive you trivializing Connie Sachs, but Anne? Her power and influence trivializes the whole damn Circus, and you take her out? Hiding Anne as you did, you give the audience the one same blind spot Smiley has. How can we know the stakes, or what was achieved, if we only see as far as his own limitations? Even if he sees past those limitations at the end, we are still blind. Imagine a Rope where Hitchcock has removed the entire first scene. That is not a better movie.    But adding those little chess pieces made it clear what you had done. If this is about a cold-war chess game, you made it about the wrong one. Smiley vs. Karla is a Fischer vs. Spassky-level contest. But it’s not 1972. It’s 1992. The players are no longer at their peak, and playing for diminished stakes. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a story of has-beens. In it, Smiley has made mistakes that he should have caught. The mole has operated for far too long. Most of the characters are grey and broken from years of service. The whole project itself is only on the edge of concern for the higher-ups. The players are going through the motions, waiting to see who gets tired first. The danger of using metaphors is that they can get away from you, obscuring instead of revealing your subject. Your little chessmen subvert the original meaning of the film’s title. They get everyone wondering who was rook, and who was knight, and who was queen? That’s a good story device, but I think it’s where you erred, overreaching past a concise masterpiece. It’s probably the same tragic mistake the characters each make: believing that they were ever anything other than mere pawns. It’s the mistake we all make, really. Sigh.Cory Status: Air Mail (3.5/5) "},{"title":"The Artist","url":"/2012/03/02/the-artist","date":"2012-03-02 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Valeria Ghiran, boom operator, First, let me apologize. I said some things I didn’t mean when I heard you were going to work on a black and white silent film. It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia has been such a solid gig for you, and Justifiedwas just getting good! But I know you’ve always wanted to work on a real Hollywood film. TechnicallyThe Artist is French, and there’s no talking, but who’s laughing now, right? I bet nobody even blinked seeing you walk around with your big pole and microphone for the entire 35 days. I wouldn’t have. Boom operators are like the bellybuttons of film sets – we just accept they exist and have a place. Sometimes they even serve a purpose. Other times, it’s just nice when producers gloss over the crew list. Am I right? So give me the skinny baby, dish up some dirt from behind-the-scenes! For example, I know director Michel Hazanavicius is married to Bérénice Béjo, but there’s no way her and Jean Dujarin weren’t up to some “French” business between takes. I don’t think I’ve ever loved an onscreen couple as much as I did the two of them. His eyes, her smile – no offense, but I think your “sound” abilities would have only ruined what they had going. Good call to stay away. I hope you snuck into Béjo’s trailer to slip on one sleeve of her coat and touch yourself though. I would have. She managed to turn something that sounds creepy into the most beautiful moment of the film. She would have been totally flattered to find you playing with her clothes. Europeans are always so much more direct. You probably figured that out during the cute homage to your boom operating skills when Dujardin kept ruining those takes on purpose. He totally gets you – I hope you got his number. Also, I’ve been meaning to ask – what the hell was John Goodman actually saying? I assume you recorded all that gold for the DVD extras. My guess is he was speaking German, because he would blow-hard for a good 30 seconds and the title card would just say something like “Darleen!” Classic John. Maybe you can help me understand one part that bothered me. I don’t know how the whole sound department hierarchy works (besides the fact you’re at the bottom), but can you tell your bosses that using the Vertigo score killed the ending for Hitchcock fans? Depriving people of a climax after such a stimulating ordeal is akin to, well, trying to now take Kim Novak seriously. But everyone has critics. Your film, however, has fewer than most. Deservedly so. Imagine – you’ve finally worked on something that your sweetheart mother, pretentious father, colour blind brother and deaf Grandma all equally enjoy. Take some credit Val, and don’t be so offended by all the praise for this brilliant and unlikely “silent” hit. That scene, with the sound – you nailed it. The audience at my screening was so quiet you could hear a cup drop. So stop being so damn modest in all your interviews. You made a point in that negative space – just like the arrow in the FedEx logo. To me, your contribution was loud and clear.

How are things? Feeling drained? Being a stand-in is no easy feat, I know. Especially when you’re standing in the latent heat of Paul Rudd’s charm. I picture it like a sort of terrestrial version of the Van Allen radiation belt: big elliptical oblongs of handsomeness and charisma. Could you feel it? Even just a tingle? One gets the feeling that it’s waning a bit, but who cares; he can still carry a mediocre flick. Luckily, Wanderlust is pretty damn funny. It’s as good, quantitatively, as his most recent pairing with director David Wain, Role Models, but trades the man-child grotesqueries for yuppie neurotics (which isn’t to say that it doesn’t get wonderfully grotesque). This all brings me to my real question: is he as cool in real life as he is in my head? If so, do you think we could all hang out together sometime? Maybe get an apartment together? Just ask him.

For a movie about civil rights that takes place in perhaps the most abhorrent time and place for the concepts of both civility and righteousness – Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960s – I was surprised by how much the plot of The Help relies, in its muddled third act, on one of your props. Of course, I’m talking about the chocolate pie. As prop master, I imagine it was no easy task to create (or build, or bake) that pie.  For the scene to work – indeed, for the very denouement of the film to unfold in a way that is plausible – the pie has to seem irresistible. And it does. Whatever you used to create the filling (was it real chocolate, or a painted latex mold of a lesser pie?) it has a creamy texture and mahogany-and-copper color that certainly tweaks the taste buds. But your pie is more complicated than that. In addition to appearing delicious, it must also, upon the vouchsafing of some rather horrifying information, emit the vulgar essence of a dessert Dante might have been offered during his sojourn to the third circle of hell. No easy feat to accomplish with a single pastry. But don’t worry, Chris. You pulled it off. Poor Bryce Dallas Howard, who, mid-career and still with so much sweetness to offer, has made a habit lately of playing these bitchy types (I’m thinking of 50/50 from earlier this year), helps you out the best she can.  But her role as the shrieking harpy villainess – a sort of Real Racist Housewife of Jackson – is an unenviable one. After eating your pie, she summons some terrific wails and screams, but her character is so dimensionless – and, by the end, so utterly unchanged – that it’s difficult even to take pleasure in her much-deserved comeuppance. Oscar-nominee Octavia Spencer and Sissy Spacek (who knows something about the shame of interacting in unfortunate ways with bodily matter) are there to watch and gape at Howard’s histrionics, but, despite their pedigree (the supporting cast, which includes Cicely Tyson and Allison Janney, is quite good), it really is your pie that carries this vital scene. And the rest of the film, too. Which I guess was my problem, Chris. In a movie like this that searches for levity in dark places, it all comes down to finding a balance between the sweet and the foul, and you did that a lot more effectively with your pie than writer/director Tate Taylor was able to do with the rest of the film.  I guess there’s something to admire in the sincerity he so unambiguously applies to just about every scene; this is a certain type of film – a well-meaning Hollywood historical drama – and films like these always deal in absolutes.  But real-world issues like Civil Rights are often ambiguous: if not ideologically, at least in the motivations and desires of the people living through them. Where you and your props team were able to find a diverse range of mid-century toilets for the film’s other scene of scatological revenge, Taylor paints a picture of Jackson that is populated primarily by two very familiar stereotypes: the (1) wise and stoic black women who suffer silently under the autocracy of the (2) wealthy, clueless, bouffant-wearing Southern Belles. And the message, in the end, is equally middling: that the courage to persevere must come from without. The story deserves something better than that. I think that’s what bums me out the most, Chris: that the dramatic onus of a film that references the assassination of Medgar Evers and features a pretty disturbing scene of domestic violence should be placed on a single delicious dessert. At least you made it well, my friend (seriously, was it real chocolate or was it Andy Serkis in a ping-pong ball suit channeling real chocolate?). You got the smooth cocoa tones of the filling just right, but The Help, as a whole, offers a pretty marbled and tasteless view of the civil rights movement. It looks like it should taste good.  But it doesn’t.

Let me start by congratulating you on the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nomination for Monsieur Lazar. Getting the Academy to sit through another Canadian film about isolation and depression could not have been easy. Sure, there’s no weird sex or snowshoes, but opening with a teacher hanging herself in a classroom? You were probably tempted to lock the exits. Lucky for you, the story subverts expectations and turns into a genuine crowd pleaser within about five minutes. At that point, the film does a pretty good job of selling itself. But let’s go back to when you first heard writer and director Philippe Falardeau was turning a one-man play into a feature film. I imagine everyone at Telefilm was reaching for red markers. Theatre icon Daniel McIvor adapted his own solo stage effort but didn’t exactly bring down the House. International sensation Robert Lepage tried, but is now in self-imposed cinematic exile from The Far Side of the Moon. Even by Canadian standards, the initial odds of success were stacked pretty heavy against Falardeau. His last feature, It’s Not Me I Swear!, certainly proved how emotionally effective he could make an eccentric visual pallet and melancholy characters. But although you can now promote him as one of Canada’s most dependable directors, no one gets a financing carte blanche in our subsidized industry (contrary to what your detractors on Sun TV have said). So at what point did you know you might have a critical and commercial hit on your hands?  Casting Fellag as the titular star was probably a good start. The Algerian actor is apparently famous in his homeland as a comedian, but I would have never guessed. His dramatic performance is subtle, layered and enchanting in a way our native gag specialists (Jim Carrey, Mike Myers, Patrick Huard, etc.) always fall short when crossing genres. I know playing against type makes your job a nightmare, but in this case, the North American public’s unfamiliarity only helped the character’s authenticity. But please tell him that around here, only rock stars and wrestlers get to go by one name. I am confused, however, why you abandoned the Canadian poster, featuring the teacher walking alone down a hallway with a “papier poisson” taped to his back. It was such a simple and poetic moment from the film that captured the essence of his struggle to fit into his foreign home. Americans love fish-out-of-water stories too, yet the smiling family portrait with his students, when taken out of context, has far less dramatic and thematic relevance. I also struggle to understand how it helps the film commercially. But at least you stuck with a French title. Calling the film Mr. Lazhar would have robbed the story of some French post-colonial undertones, and just plain sounded banal. Kind of like why perfume companies don’t translate “eau de toilette.”  The young actors, however, did deserve more prominence in the publicity I suppose. Émilien Néron, as the troubled Simon, absolutely nails his climactic scene that is a lynch pin for the whole story. Each of the other student performances also feel refreshingly age appropriate and honest. So while I’m able to appreciate their importance after the fact, I think the film’s success in Canada proves the right poster can help the film appeal to a wider demographic than Half Nelson, or even Dead Poets Society. I’ve now seen the film twice with vastly different audiences. First with critics at a steely press and industry screening during the Toronto International Film Festival, and again months later with patriotic cheerleaders at one of Heritage Minister James Moore’s swanky Parliament Hill movie nights. In both cases, my own sample exit polls found people agreed the film was more moving because of the director’s resistance to sentimentality.  The American poster does just the opposite, but I suppose getting the Yanks to swallow a French Canadian pill requires a lot of sugar.  So here’s hoping you find continued success south of the border. With glowing hearts, Christopher P.S. Smart move taking your name off Burlesque.

I’d like to imagine that the overlong party sequence required weeks of topless extras, countless takes of jumping into the pool from every possible angle, and wild, improvised moments of debauchery for the numerous montages. But instead, I couldn’t help think of you. Why? Because apparently, I just got old. Full disclosure: the fact that I’m a very recent homeowner might have had something to do with my inability to enjoy all the onscreen anarchy. But I wasn’t alone in the audience. As I glanced around and saw people over the age of 30 shielding their eyes, it wasn’t due to any gross-out humour. It’s because we all shared the pain of responsibility. Much like you. However, I suppose it’s possible you were the film crew’s answer to the character “Costa”– charmingly conning the real property owner and neighbours into believing everything would be fine. If that’s the case, I commend you for probably negotiating lower location fees because there were no stars in the film and it was to be shot like a home-movie. After all, the producers would be the ones on the hook if things got out of control. Todd Philips and Joel Silver can certainly afford to trash whatever McMansion they need in the quest for the next box-office hit. But somehow I don’t think you treated your job with such woeful disregard for decency as the film’s awful best friend.  My suspicion is you were more like the unwanted parent of the film set, considered a “wet blanket” by all the halfwits who put this film together. If the script is any indication, you had one hell of a mess to clean up. The plot is straight out of a Katy Perry music video, and so much more (of the same). Why not go all the way, and at least render the parents as rich, uptight, repressive snobs who had the destruction of their entire personal fortune coming? And shouldn’t you give the neighbours more villainous characteristics than just calling the cops? When it comes to a sober second voice looking over the script, only the legal department spoke up. I’m guessing it was their insistence that the characters stress it’s a “seniors only” party, so we could enjoy all the bare breasts without fear of moral litigation. For that, please pass on my thanks.  So why am I upset? Did I not know what I was getting into? Well, call me as naïve as the film’s “hero” Thomas, but no, I guess I didn’t. I shouldn’t expect anything cleverer than a midget punching people in the balls from what is essentially The Teenage Hangover: Before the Blackout. But Project X one-ups those tedious exercises in “comedy” by not giving us a single character to care about. We’re more than happy to forget all the idiots we had to deal with on screen, kind of like the high school experience itself. Whoa, maybe that’s the point? Nope. This is no cautionary tale. The film wears the consequences like a badge of honor. Yet, with the exception of someone trying to torch the neighbourhood with a flame-thrower (spoiler alert?), I can’t accuse the film of not being somewhat credible. We’ve seen the YouTube interview with that Melbourne teen who undoubtedly inspired the film (made almost explicit in the final sequence). I guess that’s where my age starts to show. The cartoonish Animal House antics have now become an instruction manual for how to get popular in today’s 15 seconds of fame universe.  The Gen X answer to this film is certainly last week’s release Wanderlust. Produced by Judd Aptow, it has all the same themes, copious amounts of nudity, people taking drugs, partying all hours of the night, yet somehow gives us characters experiencing a meaningful struggle. The cardboard cutout people we get in Project X don’t truly undergo changes, they just rise superficial steps up a social ladder that’s about to end. The hollowness of this final high-note is therefore obvious to everyone outside the target demographic. Unfortunately, the kids who will eat this film up still have their biggest mistakes ahead of them. I’ve been to big, out-of-control high school house parties. A smart host usually calls the cops themselves in a closed room, then plays the hero in front of the friends while having saved face from the police. Imagine that twist, actually bringing a dimension to the characters beyond just insecure pawns. But why am I telling you this? You were supposed to be the responsible adult on set.

So many stories to tell about so many unlikely chess prodigies: the hyper-charismatic Pobo, the unsettlingly intense Justus, the ambitious Rochelle and the quiet, neurotic Alexis. And though you had to splice in a couple of awkward (and obviously staged) expositional conversations to keep the narrative moving, you’re editing gives every character – the kids, the parents, the teachers – a chance to live fully on the screen. But, really, it’s the character of Patrick, who appears late into the film as a foil to the chess team’s top guns, that makes Brooklyn Castle something more than just a story about future grandmasters and their quests to escape poverty. His minor struggles, threaded beneath the larger movements of the plot, are the humanizing element of the film. He’s the kid ranked second-to-last, who just wants to get better, who, with ADHD, struggles just to concentrate on the board, and he’s our way into the story. Late in the film, when he has his chance to finally help his team, his small moment of triumph overshadows all the climactic trophy ceremonies and celebrations. And made me cry in front of a hundred strangers.  So, yeah, thanks, Nelson. Thanks a lot.

Of faces, say. Or genitalia, perhaps. And from these molds (I’m further assuming) came the prosthetics that contribute to two of the biggest surprises in 21 Jump Street.   And this perfectly absurd reimagining of the 80s cop show turns out to be full of surprises. How well Channing Tatum’s knucklehead charm translates into comedy; how cleverly the conceit of two narcotics cops going undercover at high school is both embraced and subverted; the unexpected affection it has for its source material.  But truly, that nose and that penis—excellent mold work, Victoria. The latter elicited the loudest laugh, and the former provided me the most genuine and pleasant shock I can remember having in a movie theatre.  I’d congratulate you further, but I think the pleasure you had while making those molds was probably more rewarding that any praise I can give you.

Well, I hope you enjoyed it. Being LCD Soundsystem’s last performance ever, it sure seemed—and sounded—pretty great. And the footage you and your co-cameramen got was surprisingly intimate, considering the huge crowd filling out Madison Square Gardens. Or so I assume; shots conveying the full scale of the show, both on stage and off, were strangely lacking. Were you involved in the footage shot the next day, following frontman James Murphy around New York as he tried to decide on the next chapter of his life?

It reminds me of one of director Joe Berlinger’s earlier collaborations with co-director Bruce Sinofsky, Metallica: Some Kind of Monster. Either way, it was a nice way to represent both sides of the controversy that sprung up around Simon’s 1985 seminal album. Maybe in the end, Simon’s side gets a little more attention (the film clearly sides with that), but the depiction was much more even handed than I expected.

The polished and mannered delivery makes smart seem positively brilliant. I can tell you fussed over the finer points of Kristen Scott Thomas’s uptight take on the cutthroat political class. I could hear it in Amr Wakes’ soft spoken Western-Arab sermons. It was there in Ewan McGregor’s layman interpretation of scientific-speak. And Emily Blunt’s pitch-perfect overall charm is just beyond reproach. Altogether, Salmon Fishing in Yemen is such a light and airy affair that the whole thing floats along on personality alone. Still, I hoped the story would at least try to swim against the current of a standard romantic comedy.

First, you got to be the envy of your jealous friends, who undoubtedly  tried to claw out every detail of how the filmmakers would adapt Suzanne  Collin’s wildly popular novel The Hunger Games. More importantly  though, while you were busy running around getting coffee for the  editors, colourists, and data managers, I hope you picked up a little  something for yourself: like a lesson in how the pressures of catering  to a rabid fan-base doesn’t have to result in pandering to a common  denominator. But that doesn’t mean the producers didn’t fight hard to sell this is a family-friendly adventure flick. Luckily, a story about teenagers forced into a battle royale death match can only be sanitized so much. And you can’t alienate your core audience, who, like the citizens of Panem, want their blood, but can be won over by an unlikely love story. To pull this off, the film would need a sparkle of Twilight’s romance, a world as vivid as Harry Potter’s, and moments of moral cynicism that could have come straight from the back alleys of Gotham city. These are all decisions that are laboured over during scriptwriting and shooting, but the last word always rests in post-production. You’re like the film’s own sinister Gamemakers, who have the ability to twist and amend events in whatever way suits the studio’s final agenda. And you won.   The film earns its PG-13 rating by respecting our imagination. Shaky camera work, in the popular Paul Greengrass mode, provides an aura of violence without ever being explicit. In fact, the post-production treatment often abstains altogether from sound and gore, to maximum effect. If you grew up attending the Michael Bay school of action, I’m sure you thought the speakers in the editing room were broken when you first saw the Cornucopia slaughter that opens the games. Saving the visual theatrics for the story’s climax is one of the smartest decisions in the film. I’m sure nobody worried about cutting around Jennifer Lawrence’s performance as Katniss. Beautiful, soulful, intense; she has a face that seems to transform from scene to scene, depending on lighting and angles; we never feel like we know what to expect from her.  From her shattered scream of volunteering for the Games, to her strained expressions as she tries to figure out how to play to the crowd during her pre-Game interviews, Lawrence is the anchor we need to sustain our interest. Unlike the book’s first-person narrative (ever spelling out her motivations) her performance only requires a simple glance of uncertainty, or mistrust, or determination to draw us in. Voiceovers be damned.  I do imagine, however, that there were some lengthy debates made in post-production about the use of Caesar Flickerman and Claudius Templesmith. Only a couple times did the narrative resort to their play-by-play in order to elaborate on diegetic specifics (like the deadly tracker jackers). For a concept that is essentially about a reality show, it would seem a natural fit to shift the narrative focus to the television viewer’s perspective to help us fill in the blanks. Woody Harrelson certainly manages to do a lot with his minimum time on screen, but his Haymitch character, who mentors the kids and sweet talks sponsors into getting them gifts, felt like a natural place to expand the storytelling circle. Instead, a quick dialogue-free shot informs us he’s working behind-the-scenes on our hero’s behalf. Less, again, proves to be more. So there you have it, a killer résume credit and hopefully a window into what works in post-production. Nice work if you can get it, eh?

It’s also fitting because, well, that crowded, never-ending credit crawl looked more like a holocaust memorial than a professional title listing. So let’s take a minute to mourn your loss. If you’re one of the lucky ones, you got away with animating part of the opening village attack by a two-headed chimera. You know, that fleeting seven-second-long take where the audience could temporarily follow the action.  Was that you? No, chances are yours was among the fallen efforts that built the overly complicated labyrinth, of which we only ever experience a few corridors. Maybe you were on thankless dust and smoke detail, clouding over everyone else’s designs. If not, perhaps you spent sleepless nights bringing the Minotaur to life, only to have it completely obscured by shadows and incompetent editing. Worst of all, could it be that your tireless effort was put to the service of animating Kronos, duped into believing that working on the ultimate villain would offer the biggest payoff? If so, you must be painfully disappointed.  Here’s a good rule of thumb next time you pick a project: in superhero/sci-fi/fantasy films, the dramatic impact of a climax is inversely proportional to the physical size difference between the hero and the villain. In other words, the bigger the bad guy, the harder it is to care. Think of Spider-Man 3, The Green Lantern, Matrix: Reloaded – the more outmatched the battle, the less interesting the fight. When a ridiculous strategy is all that can stop a ridiculous monster, nobody wins. The formula works both ways (which is why they can’t seem to make a good Superman film). For the perfect balance, please refer to Rocky IV. In the end, it must be heartbreaking to know that all the hours you put in could barely motivate a shrug from the audience, who rightfully require emotional engagement to care about what’s happening. The strained dialogue and brainless story weren’t going to get it, so it was all up to Sam Worthington’s acting. Yikes. Maybe you needed a few more animators after all.

Of course you get it. You grew up in Montreal, arguably the world’s capital of hockey – certainly the nexus of hockey’s most impassioned, self-immolating fans – and that’s probably why, in bringing Goon to the big screen, you were able to avoid the instructional mode that most hockey movies waste their exposition on. Instead, the film embraces more nuanced aspects of the game: traffic in front of the net, line changes on the fly, resentment over ice time. And that attention to detail, that trust you have in the audience—it can be said of the characters, too. You didn’t completely abandon all those sports movie archetypes (we get the worn-out veteran, the eccentric goalie, the pair of obnoxious Russians, the young superstar who plays only for himself) but because they exist in a world where the physics of hockey make sense, their idiosyncrasies makes sense, too. Veterans do get worn out, goalies are eccentric (anyone who has seen Ilya Bryzgalov in the HBO series 24/7 has observed this firsthand). Rooted in this kind of realism – though it may only be apparent to someone who understands that game the way you and I do – the characters are free to breathe in scenes outside the rink. And this serves no one more than Seann William Scott, who is able, in this environment, to shed the tiresome jackassery of his Stiffler persona and create one of the most lovable sociopathic pugilists since Rocky.  Stripped of his self-awareness, he’s funniest, here, because he’s not trying so, so, so hard to be funny. Unlike most Canadian movies, it feels like a movie made for Canadians. Not an indulgent bit of cultural masturbation (we’re chronic masturbators, aren’t we?).

Also see Jared Young’s review. Dear Jordu Schell, Conceptual Creature Designer, You are the only person involved in this film that I will give a free pass. You aren’t paid to question the writer’s motivations or the director’s vision. After reading this script, you just knew it was a portfolio jackpot and never looked back, right? Well, you’re lucky. I stepped out of the theater with question after unresolvable question popping up in my head. This wasn’t’ the satisfying puzzlement that cleverly ambiguous or intellectually intriguing films inspire, but simple bafflement at how the entire premise was so thinly strung together. It’s a first-class case of half-baked ideas buried under a steaming pile of over-indulgence. I expect a lot more from co-writer and producer Joss Wheland in particular, a respected leader in modern geek culture. But this comedy/horror/sci-fi/fantasy mash-up makes its genres strangely cancel out their individual effectiveness (O Edgar Wright, where art thou?). The result is a film that aims at post-modern pastiche and ends up feeling like mindless pandering to a very specific fan base. Perhaps director Drew Goddard thought your creations, made with love and care, would be so good that people would simply turn off their brains to a concept so severely flawed it should never exist in the first place. Unfortunately, your efforts could only suspend my disappointment until the final credit role, where I was left stupefied by your collaborators.  In order to respect the project, I’m trying to avoid spoiler territory, in case someone intercepts our correspondence (imagine!). But I will say that Fran Kranz’s burnout character was so cliché (no, not in a clever “that’s the point” way, sorry) and painstakingly favoured in the script that it undermined any chance the film had at finding a soul. And I won’t even start on Richard Jenkin’s “dude” dialogue that an actor half his age would still have problems choking out. It’s what happens when you can’t decide if you want to be a film, or be an experimental fan-fiction-masturbation about films. For me, “too much wasted effort” was the overall theme of the film, laboring simple ideas to the point of unintelligible exhaustion.

And they’re not wrong: the super-max prison (yours is on a space station), the first-family hostage (you’ve swapped the salt-and-pepper President for his comely daughter, played here by Maggie Grace), the squinty, thuggish, quick-witted super-soldier (you traded young Kurt Russell for not-so-young Guy Pearce), and an escape-pod-load of other Easter-eggs I surely missed. But there’s a lot more going on here than a slavish ripping-off of everyone’s favourite post-apocalyptic action-comedy, isn’t there? First of all, let’s not call it a rip-off, because that implies an act of theft. Shakespeare borrowed liberally from Plutarch’s Parallel Lives to conjure rich historical details in plays like Antony & Cleopatra, and, as in his work, which enriched and contextualized existing tropes, all the appropriation here is above board. In fact, it seems to be the whole point. So let’s call Lockout what it is: a tribute. But it’s not just Escape that you’re borrowing from; and it’s not just a genre, or style, or era. It’s…well, everything. There are direct allusion to Aliens and Die Hard, minor tics and twitches adopted from The Road Warrior and Minority Report, a denouement that unfolds like a parody of The Usual Suspects, and even a weirdly misplaced impression of Dustin Hoffman in Rain Main. On paper, at least, you created the ultimate mash-up flick. Lockout, then, should be a cinema geek’s nirvana. But the whole is slightly less than the sum of its parts.  It doesn’t – it can’t, really – live up to the high standard set by all those other films. That’s the danger of riffing, in the Shakespearian manner, off past masterpieces: sometimes, in the remixing, what made them great is lost. Anyways, what I wanted to tell you, Luc, is that I appreciated the effort. Sincerely, Jared Young PS.  I think you and I both know that the real reason to sit through these 90 minutes is for Guy Pearce. His Snake McClane (or John Plissken—tomato, tomah-to) is able to make more of your often blocky dialogue than poor Maggie Grace, who spends half the flick looking like Tetsuo from Akira. He’s a worthy heir to Russell, and his performance is the closest Lockout ever gets to playing on the same field as its source material.

The invisible perfection you paint on the faces of actors provides the camouflage they need to bear their souls to an unforgiving camera. Yet other times, you know that a little flare can go a long way. In films like The Dark Knight, Apocalypse Now and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, full-on war paint is essential for pushing a character through improbable dramatic turns and to suspend our disbelief.  Lucky you - getting to apply both these principles to the real-life story of Canadian bank robbing folk hero Edwin Boyd. Writer and director Nathan Morlando’s washed-out colours and blown out skies led you in the right direction, creating an aura of depression that we don’t normally associate with the postwar boom. The diluted palette accentuates the drained, desperate, and debonair look on Scott Speedman’s self-applied game face, brought to life by simple shoe polished cheekbones, white face powder and performer’s eyeliner. More than a disguise, you revealed something deeper about the anti-hero’s struggle and fragility. But like all great make-up artists, you saved your talent for when it mattered most: the subtle aging process near the end, illustrating the toll of the lifestyle on the film’s central characters.  Boyd benefitted from a time when 15 minutes of fame stretched into years, thanks to a still-fledgling Canadian media. Discarded as a soldier and disheartened as an aspiring actor, he eventually got his coveted close-up in the spotlight.

The movie was very good. People are very annoyed. There was beautiful cinematography, interesting characters, and heartfelt emotion. And there was you, all jibber, jabber, jabber. To be fair, I know you weren’t talking to me. You were talking to all the monkeys running around the theatre.

It was maybe damaging. Your banter, along with some really strangely-chosen swing music, became an awkward addition that obscured the story itself.   And what a story! I love how Disney has revived Walt’s original idea of narrated nature stories. But these latest stories reflect many of the truths about nature that were still hidden when I was a kid. I don’t think any child was traumatized by any of the harsh realities of the jungle, but I think kids today are better off for the honesty. Superb. I wish I could have played a part of it.

I wasn’t among them. The 100th anniversary of the real-life event was bound to be flooded with free media attention, and against all odds, the key players involved (James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) have only continued to float higher and higher in popular acclaim. The only real question was how would the movie itself hold up—especially in 3D? With your help, Matt, it held up just swimmingly, thank you very much. First things first: can you back me up when I say 3D isn’t synonymous with eye-popping spectacle?  People have already forgotten why they were so enraptured by Avatar’s 3D: it was the restraint, simplicity, and immersive quality of the effect, not a gimmick that pulls images off the screen and viewers out of the film.  James Cameron’s approach was almost counter-revolutionary; like Jack White stripping back rock-and-roll to make it feel new again. I’m glad to see he guided you and your team down the same path for the re-release of this unapologetically overboard – but nonetheless spectacular – crowning achievement.   From the underwater sequences in the first act to the thrilling climax, nothing suffered in the post-conversion.

Dever, Military Technical Advisor I never thought I‘d see you on this side of a war.  You know what I mean – lending credibility to a Zac Efron and Nicholas Sparks film. But here we are. Sure, people watching war movies expect the characters to hold guns properly, move like real soldiers, and furrow their brows sufficiently when “shit gets real.” That this may not actually be a demographic interested in this film is beside the point. When a soldier like you gets called to duty, he obeys orders. The Lucky One opens in, of all places, Iraq, where Efron plays Marine Logan Thibault on his third tour. Fair enough. I can see the need for your expertise here. In short order, we see Thibault’s unit shot up, blown up, and ambushed.  That Thibault isn’t included in the escalating body count is credited to a photo he found in the rubble, a photo of a beautiful woman—his “guardian angel,” so to speak. On returning to his native Colorado, Thibault, decides to seek out his angel and deliver this picture to her as some sort of not-very-well-explained healing process. I suppose I can buy that. But you lost me when he finds this woman by matching the lighthouse in the photo with a lighthouse picture he finds on Google. If I was a betting man, my first guess on seeing a lighthouse in any picture would be “vacation,” not “the quaint seaside town she calls home.” But help me out, is light house identification one of the core skills learned on Paris Island? I wouldn’t know, as my main Marine knowledge maxed out with the introduction of Gung-Ho to G. I. Joe in 1983.  Against all odds, though, Thibault does identify that fated lighthouse and travels to Louisiana from Colorado. By foot. Now this is where your training for Efron obviously paid off. He somehow shows no ill effects from what would be a good 15-day trek. His loyal dog even accompanies him for the entire journey. Semper Fi, indeed. But that dog’s not just there to provide what counts as character development in a Sparks story (guys who like animals can’t be bad, after all). No, as luck would have it,  Thibault’s ‘angel,’ Beth (Taylor Schilling), runs a dog kennel in what appears to be a giant southern mansion. This gives Thibault the perfect reason to stick around and not have to explain the actual creepy reason he’s come to see her. If only Efron’s character could avoid plot contrivances the way he dodged Iraqi sniper bullets. Being an industrious Marine, though, Thibault rents a nearby place; a run down shack he sizes up in a gaze* that can mean only one thing: “I can totally fix this up in a montage.” *That gaze! You must have helped here. Efron’s desperately trying to capture the thousand-yard stare of a man who’s seen too many horrors. Unfortunately his interpretation comes off as more Travis Bickle than Ron Kovic. Once the film settles in Louisiana, The Lucky One shifts into full Sparks mode. As a member of the crew, you don’t need me to lay it all out for you. And since director Scott Hicks is so fond of using montages to develop even the shortest time lapses, I’ll provide my own montage of Sparks-isms: the cute, moppet-haired child, the wise-cracking-but-truth-talking elder, the jealous-to-the-point-of-violence ex, sex in the falling water (an outdoor shower ably standing in for the rain here), and, of course, a sacrifice during the denouement. Whew, I got tired just writing those out. No wonder this film needed a marine to get through all that.

And it’s a good thing, too. Because the success of Richard Linklater’s dramatization of the Bernie Tiede murder case rests squarely upon the difficult narrative conceit that we’re watching a magazine article come to life. The story isn’t told from Bernie’s point-of-view, or even in the omniscient present-tense, but is rather retold by a Greek chorus of gossipy East Texas townspeople who, over the course of several years, observed from afar the strange relationship between Tiede (Jack Black) and his benefactor (and eventual victim) played by a lemon-faced Shirley MacLaine. Whether this was going to work or not was completely up to you.  And, boy, does it work.  Tina, I don’t know where you rounded up this Avengers-like super-team of expressive, winsome, drawling southerners, but they carry the momentum of the film in such an easy way that one forgets how tenuous the whole structure is. With professional actors, it could have been utterly boring. But you managed to find real people. Earthy, funny people. And because the responsibility of generating laughs is taken away from Black, he’s able to settle into a performance that is so weirdly sweet and restrained (even as he breaks into show-tunes) that it might be his best ever. He owes you. And so does Linklater. And so does co-star Matthew McConaughey, because the cameo by his mother might just make her a star. I also wanted to say, if you find yourself, in the near future, casting a small role for a masculine, square-jawed, acerbic Jon Hamm-type with a Canadian accent, please be in touch.  Y’All Take Care Now,  Jared Young Status: Priority Post (4.5/5)"},{"title":"The Pirates!

Knowing that what’s being filmed isn’t just a bunch of ones and zeros, but a solid substance – that I, like you, could hold in my hand – often makes the action and characters feel just as tangible. It’s a shame that poor 3D effects and a 2D script had to undermine your efforts. What happened? The titular band of misfits you created certainly fit the physical bill for a family comedy: The Pirate Captain as bushy-bearded leader, The Pirate with Gout as tubby sidekick, The Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate as tomboy-in-disguise, The Albino Pirate as…well, maybe a way to save on your paint budget (his condition was strangely never mentioned). Sure they looked good, but it’s what’s on the inside that counts—even with clay puppets. For an adventure that positions Charles Darwin as the morally ambiguous ally and Queen Victoria as the villain, there’s a surprising lack of punch to the comedy. The Pirate Captain’s vain attempt to win the Pirate of the Year award is a worthy story engine, but the lengthy set-up of his poorly-voiced adversaries never pays off like it should. Like the pirates themselves who are constantly disappointed by their lackluster looting, I also expected bigger rewards from the studio that gave us Wallace and Grommit.  Instead, I left with a modest bounty that is bound to drown in a sea of better animated films.

As the breakout star of Steve McQueen’s ode to impassive sex and emotional vacancy, there’s no denying that you have a commanding screen presence. It was hard to take my eyes off you—yet I think your contributions to the film are being overlooked. Indeed, it’s when you’re out of frame that you do your best work. You play the very busy penis of Brandon (Michael Fassbender), a handsome single fellow of undefined professional orientation who lives out a teenage male fantasy in his barren New York bachelor-pad: sex with prostitutes, sex with socialites beneath the New Jersey turnpike, sex with himself in front of his laptop. When Brandon’s sister (Carey Mulligan) shows up to spend a few nights on the couch, and, in a drunken fit, beds one of his colleagues, it’s your jealous twitching that drives him to seek solace in ever more dangerous – and wanton – sexual scenarios.   But the truth is, while you’re clearly working hard throughout, it’s the one scene in which you’re not working that best exemplifies McQueen’s diagnostic treatment of Brandon’s peculiar fetish (which, really, is a broad, all-encompassing fetish for everything dispassionate and mechanical). The moment most difficult to watch isn’t when Brandon has you dipping in and out of two prostitutes, or even when, desperate for release, he takes you into the back room of a gay night club—it’s when, seemingly on the precipice of finding himself in a real human relationship, your disinterest sabotages the affair.   Though it’s full of sex, Shame is by no means a sexy film. Even the scene you share with Carey Mullligan’s vagina (in which, unseen, you are nonetheless a threatening offscreen presence) has a medical coldness to it. Which is the point, I suppose. To be titillated by Brandon’s exploits would be contradictory; he, himself, isn’t titillated by them. Only, perhaps, by the idea of them. Clearly you and Mr. Fassbender work well together. The scenes you share (in the shower, in the bathroom stall at his workplace) suggest an intimacy long in the making. I hope to see you collaborating again sometime soon. Maybe the next X-Men movie? Surely Magneto, in those burgundy tights, surrounded by teenage runaways, has a few psychosexual issues that need to be explored.      Enviously, Jared Young Status: Air Mail (3.5/5) "},{"title":"Safe","url":"/2012/05/08/safe","date":"2012-05-08 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Mike Groner, Insurance Broker Be honest: you must go into a cold sweat when you see a Jason Statham film come across your desk. Everything that makes his films work surely makes your job a living nightmare. No other action star over the past decade has been so dedicated and single-minded in their pursuit of pure testosterone-fueled action heroics. Sure, Safe breaks the mold from time-to-time by offering us deeper moments of vulnerability, but only as a explosive counterpoint to what’s next.  For me, it started early on when director Boaz Yakin used that long take to force, on cue, a tear from Statham’s eye. We know he does his own stunts, but producing his own tears? Impressive stuff. At this point, as you first read the script, it’s possible you believed you had a nice comfortable drama on your hands; nothing but standard liabilities to worry about.  You may have even thought, as the narrative folds in a young Asian wiz-kid, that this generation was finally getting their Cop and a Half.  Fortunately, you didn’t get off so easy.  The paternal instinct Statham displays for the film’s code-cracking McGuffin (Catherine Chan) is designed less to show his vulnerability than to offer a purpose for his no-holds-barred protection of her. Such character development was just enough to keep me invested during the one-man war he wages against the Russian Mafia, Chinese Crimelords, and the corrupt New York Police force. From your point of view, sure, it’s just a mounting pile of paperwork. But for the rest of us, I promise, it’s much more thrilling. The action pieces come hard and fast, brought to life by efficient choreography that helps the action feel exciting and (cover your eyes!) dangerous.  The hand-held yet surprisingly fluid cinematography certainly helps make the risks feel realistic. By the time the mid-town shoot-out rolled around, I had to remind myself that equipment is just as liable as people on-set.  Man, you must have hated this film. I’m sure you learned your lesson. If you’re looking to minimize damage claims, steer clear of any and all Jason Statham vehicles (including actual vehicles).

Getting that perfect oval shape, the firm whites and thick-but-runny yolk—it takes practice. Lots of practice. Why do I mention this? Because, in the goofily charming introduction to our characters in The Five-Year Engagement, we meet Tom (Jason Segel) as he prepares a pair of perfectly poached eggs. This may be the first time I’ve ever seen food preparation used as character development. It’s immediately clear that this isn’t the standard man-child that populates much of producer Judd Apatow’s work. No, Tom is an accomplished chef living and working in San Francisco, on the path to being head chef at a new it-restaurant. He’s also recently engaged to prospective psychology grad student Violet (Emily Blunt). In other words, his soufflé is on the rise. This being a comedy, though, eggs – and hearts – are sure to break. Soon enough, Violet is accepted into a graduate program in Ann Arbor, Michigan, (apparently Hollywood’s version of hell). So Tom makes the bitter choice to follow his bride-to-be to her new school. Now that he’s given up his dream job as a head chef, it might seem like there’s no longer a place for you to practice your fine food stylings. But like I said earlier, character development. Whether it’s tasting wedding cakes, preparing venison Tom has hunted himself, or even avoiding the temptation of day-old donuts, food helps flavour Tom and Violet’s evolving relationship.  And it all works. The ups, downs, and in-betweens of this protracted courtship are always involving and well-defined; often because of the food you have placed on screen. In fact, this film brings together two of what appear to be Segel’s obsessions: Muppets and food. What other writer would hinge a climactic scene on Cookie Monster and find a way to make it work?

And it’s your job, Richard, to make sure no one – including God – rains on their parade. Until the reviews come out, anyway. The good news is, you might be in the clear for Dark Shadows. The world you’ve created is, refreshingly enough, darker in spirit than in design. For a film that’s played for laughs, there are some pretty black turns. When Barnabas Collins, the film’s charming-but-creepy vampire protagonist (played by Depp), breaks free of his 200-year entrapment into 1972, he savagely murders an entire construction crew. And that’s just the start. The literal and metaphorical fogs in which he is lost actually come together to create a dreary mood of lost love.  Well done.  But then the sun comes out. Depp’s Barnabas Collin’s only treats sunlight as only a minor inconvenience, strolling about the town with minimal protection. Didn’t you remind them that even humans today fear the sun’s deadly cancer yielding rays?  For a vampire, that fear should be tenfold. But maybe you all just couldn’t resist getting out of the green screen studio for a few days.  Fair enough. The films does spend an awful lot of time indoors, setting up family dynamics that offer little payoff. Chloë Grace Mortez, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Jonny Lee Miller all seem game to play ball, but are never given a moment to shine.

And, more than that, treats your Slurpee-induced reveries with such respect, such veneration?  I can’t. In about ten years you’ll discover John Updike and he’ll offer some germane advice on this topic. In developing a series of guidelines that would define his criticism, he warned: “Do not accept for review a book you are predisposed to dislike, or committed by friendship to like. Do not imagine yourself a caretaker of any tradition, an enforcer of any party standards, a warrior in an ideological battle, a corrections officer of any kind.” You might not feel like a caretaker of tradition right now, but, when you hit your thirties, you’ll find that you spend most of your free time caretaking the tradition of being twelve years-old. And though I’m not committed by friendship to like The Avengers, I am committed to you, twelve-year-old me – to seeking those unconditional, uncorrupted thrills that conjure you out the past – and that makes it impossible for me to apply the sort of ideological objectivity that Updike argues is essential to the critic’s trade.   You’ll find, as you get older, that it’s easy to be cynical about almost everything—movies like The Avengers, in particular. Sure, the characters are commodities, pawns in the great big box office Ponzi scheme. But what does the context matter to you, childhood self? You don’t care about the marketing budget or the promotional tie-ins or the per-screen averages. What matters most to you are the witty physics of the comic book world, the ecstasy of two opposing forces coming colorfully together: Thor dropping Mjolnir onto Cap’s vibranium shield, Iron Man’s mid-air suit-up, Loki’s ill-planned sermon to the Hulk (who, with a single punch, forgives all of Ang Lee and Edward Norton’s well-meant missteps). What matters to you is what’s onscreen, and, from this future vantage point, I assure you that what’s onscreen will exceed your expectations. We begin with an introduction to that most ineffable of MacGuffins: the Cosmic Cube (renamed, here, The Tesseract), which leads, of course, to dimensional portals, mind control, and alien invasions. The usual stuff. But it’s not just the spectacle of computer effects that brings to life the world of the comics (they’ve come a long way since the liquid metal Terminator you’re currently so enamored of); it’s the miraculous feat of screenwriting that divides time equally between all six protagonists, giving each their moment of bombastic heroism, each their moment of existential worry; it’s the characters you love brought brilliantly to life by actors who take seriously the responsibility of living up to a half-century’s-worth of character notes; it’s the pure pop expression of the superhero myth, which, in the Marvel Universe, was never a fantasy about control, but about a lack of it.   I have some bad news, me. You’re soon going to learn that the world is a much more complicated place than you think. You’ve been raised to have faith in the credo that all things are possible, and that’s a fine thing to believe, but passing time will prove it to be a figurative statement.  It’s not a matter of cynicism or optimism. It’s a matter of knowledge. You’re going to gain it. And sometimes knowledge sucks.  But I have some good news, too. Despite everything that’s going to happen between now and now – all the disappointments, all the sad insights into the way the world really works, all the things you once thought possible so clearly revealed to be just the opposite – you have this one great thing to look forward to: a guy named Joss Whedon is going to make an Avengers movie, and he’s going to make it just for you.

And in this particular race to the bottom, you certainly won. From three-time Academy Award nominee at age 25, to production assistant at age 30? Downhill Racer, indeed. I’m kidding, of course. I understand it was a nicety and by no means a necessity that you recopied script pages and wardrobe-shopped for Robert Redford’s 1969 passion project. Luckily, the Criterion Collection’s restored copy of this forgotten classic has done a great job giving you, and the film itself, some well deserved credit after the film first stumbled and crashed on its release. Yet the premise must have struck a chord with you. So down you went. On to the film set. To lend a hand. Like a good friend. You had some help. Director Michael Ritchie does a brilliant job of giving the audience a first-person perspective of the breakneck adventures of downhill skiing. But by all accounts in the DVD extras, it was Redford’s personal determination that got the film made. For your sake, however, I hope Redford was nothing like the film’s arrogant and bullish hero: abundant with talent and indulged by those around him by the promise of fame, fortune, and glory. I imagine you instead being spirited away by his passion (and possibly his good looks) to create a film about the mantra of winning at all costs. And, if that was the case, maybe you would have been smarter to hitch your horse to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, which came out the same year.

Was there ever a sense that you had put yourself in mortal danger by agreeing to provide personal security for a rabble-rousing comedian famous for invading the most unlikely American places with his unsettling European pansexuality? When you took the gig on his new film, The Dictator, you surely knew he was setting his sights on fanatical Middle Eastern despots. Instant fatwa, right? The paper-thin premise of the film involves a body double, an assassination attempt, and several Inception-like layers of mistaken identity. So, tell me: how many layers of Kevlar did you wear to the set every day? How often did you practice that heroic bullet-thwarting dive?  How many lurking paparazzi did you mistake for assassins and cripple with a throat-crushing judo chop? I’m guessing zero. You know how I know that? Mark, I swear I’m not one of those types easily offended by the sort of humor Baron Cohen is famous for. I know that being offended is the whole point, and, by giving in, you cease to be a member of the audience and become, instead, the butt of the joke—but the sort of casual xenophobia he and collaborator Larry Charles have so effectively commoditized only works when it operates in the service of a larger idea. And that’s what’s missing in The Dictator. Maybe it’s because this is their first wholly fictional film (though there’s a bit of cinema verite in the middle act, in which the titular dictator, deposed and stranded in New York City, wanders through midtown harassing passersby and police). The great subversive thrust of the Borat and Bruno characters wasn’t the outrageous things they said; it was the way people reacted to them. In those interactions was revealed the great truth that, for all our world-leading ambitions, the West can be just as provincial as anywhere else. Here, Baron Cohen’s bigotries are shouted into the emptiness. There’s no one there to answer. And that, Mark, is how I know you were never afraid for your life—because Baron Cohen’s fumbling Admiral General isn’t clever enough to outrage anyone. The comedic atrocities he commits are minor in both scope and wit. And they’re guilty, as well, of a far worse crime: being forgettable.

The long drives to and from the airport, the daily errands, the interminable waiting around on set.  But while you were sitting bored in the driver’s seat, watching through the windshield as Wim Wender’s atmospheric, elliptical and hypnotic film Paris, Texas was being shot, you were unknowingly witnessing a masterpiece take shape before your eyes.  Yet you might have thought Harry Dean Stanton was being extremely rude, sitting silently in the back seat as you peppered him with questions. I can tell you now that it wasn’t contempt for the crew. It was method acting. Channeling the enigma of Travis Henderson that he so gracefully presents throughout the film undoubtedly took focus. But I’ll understand if you felt as alienated as Dean Stockwell’s character who comes to rescue Travis from the desert. No one likes getting the silent treatment. But think of this - it’s a truism that the more we learn about a character, the less interesting they become. So a delicate balance must be maintained to keep an audience invested in someone who so adamantly denies them even the smallest shred of personal information. We know Travis has a 7-year-old son, but we don’t understand how he could have abandoned him, and everyone else, for four years. We can see that he’s damaged and disillusioned, but any reasons provided would probably just further frustrate us. As a narrative puzzle, Travis is ours to rebuild with only a few corner pieces to guide us. Luckily, those pieces are compelling enough to keep us along for the ride. You see, it can go the other way, too. Remember when Darth Vader died at the end of Return of the Jedi?  You should, it was just last year. Wouldn’t it ruin everything if you had to see his life unfold as a child? Fortunately, Wenders has a great sense of direction. He beautifully navigates the barren Texas desert with the comfort of a veteran tour guide. It’s all the more impressive because screenwriter Sam Sheppard’s story goes completely off the map.  Important characters are left by the wayside as the story steers itself through a personal epiphany with ease – like he’s delivering a hot bowl of soup on a bumpy back road without spilling a drop. We don’t even care if the story never looks back at where it started. The soup is that good. In fact, the film finds a soul in the extended climax that is completely unexpected and almost self-contained in its impact. The moment is personal piece of redemptive heaven somewhere safely off the grid. In the end, I hope you enjoyed your quiet drives through the desert, and appreciated the contrast between the busy city highways featured later in the film.

You seem to be the Second-Second-Assistant-Director-of-choice for Hollywood’s biggest-budget summer tent-pole films. After seeing Battleship, one film on your resume caught my eye. Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen. No, I’m not making the obvious connection—that both films are “from” toy company Hasbro (which makes them sound like they were assembled from punched-out plastic pieces on some factory assembly line). What I’m talking about is the looming shadow of director Michael Bay. Sure, Battleship director Peter Berg eschews the rapid-fire editing style that defines Bay’s action aesthetic (and, believe me, that alone elevates this to a level of competence the Transformers sequels don’t even aspire to). Apart from that, though, the film is a pretty pure example of modern cinema’s most depressing trends. You may not know this, but this movie apparently had a plot. Which begins like this: after discovering an earth-like planet, NASA sends out an intergalactic “Oh, hai!” that draws from the reaches of space some vague form of sentient life that comes to earth to…well, that’s never clear, but, whatever it is, it’s definitely not friendly. Because these interstellar travellers forgot to plan their atmospheric entry, they end up crashing into the Pacific Ocean—less than a mile, of course, from where American and Japanese naval forces are holding military exercises. Hilarity ensues. Hostile aliens. Military response. Explosions. These seem to be your areas of second-second-assistant-directing expertise. But it’s the tone (or tones, since the film can’t seem to settle on one) that I wanted to ask you about, Marvin. Every scene in this movie is directed to achieve maximum…well, everything. Apparently an alien invasion is no longer sufficiently awesome enough to keep an audience’s attention. When our hero Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) buys a burrito to impress attractive dialogue delivery device Brooklyn Decker—he buys a burrito to the extreme, breaking into a convenience store, destroying it, and getting tazed. While you were corralling all the extras playing cops and organizing the stunt drivers for that one minor expository scene, did it ever occur to you that this was an exercise in excess for the sake of excess? Then again, maybe these movies need this sort of hyperactive, brainless forward momentum. This is one dumb, cynical movie, and any distraction from that dumb cynicism can’t be a bad thing.  Most troubling, though? Battleship wants us to revere the military and love its characters, yet also takes immense pleasure in watching those good men blow up (and they blowed up real good). Can you sense these weird shifts on set, Marvin, or is this simply the magic of post-production? Hell, this movie doesn’t even seem to have much faith in its own heroes. The Greatest Generation has to save the day.

You’ve twice experienced the miracle of childbirth and surely possess the sort of arcane knowledge that the best-selling pregnancy guide, first published in 1984, has provided to a generation of expectant moms. I’ll even concede that the task assigned to you and co-writer Shauna Cross was near-impossible: adapt an instructional non-fiction health manual into a Hollywood film big enough to accommodate any number of ascending B-list and declining A-list stars. So, what happened? The approach you took was smart: create a sort of Altman-esque tapestry of braided narratives, each focused on a unique element of the pregnancy experience—like Nashville, but marching towards the delivery room instead of a political rally. Sadly, what we’re left with is more New Year’s Eve than Short Cuts. San Francisco is the setting. Elizabeth Banks, Jennifer Lopez, Cameron Diaz, and Anna Kendrick are the soon-to-be moms. The guy from Glee and the Air Marshal from Bridesmaids are the patently uninteresting husbands. The director is Kirk Jones, and he handles every scene with the same pop-music gentility, which sometimes works (as during the Ethiopian adoption ceremony) and often doesn’t (as during the cruelly interminable lead-up to a miscarriage diagnosis). The timing and telemetry is lifted directly from every romantic comedy released over the last twenty years, and the result is something that seems beyond cliché. It’s like one of those movie scene mash-ups you might find on YouTube. But less clever. You know, it’s not really fair of me to bring up Robert Altman. I was just trying to make myself sound smart. I can’t blame you for not achieving what you didn’t set out to do. Maybe you weren’t writing this screenplay as an exercise in formalist storytelling. Maybe you were writing it for the moms. Maybe you were trying to tell their story: the secret story of birth, which, in the movies, is so often played for laughs, reduced to a few minutes of sexualized huffing and puffing and cursing, followed by a tearful cuddle with an eerily beatific, gleaming-clean, six month-old stunt-baby. But I saw this in a theater full of moms, and there was never that big moment of shared recognition, that cathartic uniting of the audience behind an unspoken truth suddenly, shockingly, candidly exposed. In a film that should have been full of such moments, there are none. Even The Avengers was able to unite the assembled geeks and nerds and fanboys in spontaneous cheers at the sight of the Helicarrier, Avengers Tower, Thanos: all that secret folklore made wonderfully public. Surely childbirth has a more beautiful, vital mythology than the Marvel Universe?   My issue, Heather, is that you took a book that became iconic for its gruesome, pragmatic, uncompromising honesty and turned it into a movie that has nothing remotely honest to say. Like I said earlier, as a mother of two you were no doubt qualified to write this screenplay. But, as a mother of two, how do you feel about promoting these bland platitudes about pregnancy?

Especially when it comes to liberating a restless spirit with immediate results. No wonder director Walter Salles relied so heavily on your expertise in adapting one of the 20th century’s most groundbreaking pieces of English prose. On the Road, of course, is by no means a big screen musical. But it struck me that the film is chaptered by three key dance sequences that segment Jack Kerouac’s story of Beat Generation writers roaming across America in the 1950s. And, in each dance sequence, we are given insight to the evolving relationships of our characters and around them times begin to change. We begin with a slow dance between Kerouac’s alter ego, Sal Paradise (Sam Riley), and the eager-to-please Marylou (Kristen Stewart). Tepid, respectful, curious, and hopeful, the two share a tender moment in a crowded whites-only bar. Sal is an aspiring writer, still not comfortable in his own skin, and searching for an outlet to explore his intellectual, philosophical, and sexual curiosities. And it all begins with a dance. Yet there isn’t a shred of jealously coming from the carefree gaze of Dean Moriarty (Garret Hedlund), Marylou’s boyfriend—and everyone else’s love affair. We understand immediately that the group’s dynamic will not devolve into melodrama, and their struggles are more about discovering themselves than about discovering their partners. So, with no story engine more powerful than ennui, On the Road we go. The stage is set for act two: after months of lean living and rotating relationships, our main characters are once again at a bar—this time with explosive live jazz and coloured company. This is where your dance expertise shines. The freewheeling, passion-fueled dance between Marylou and Dean not only captivates the entire bar, but the film audience as well. It’s more than just sweaty foreplay; we feel the characters breaking through a culture still scarred by war, and soon to be scandalized by Elvis Presley’s hips. Powerful thing, that dancing. And by the film’s climax, Eva, you push them beyond what one might readily define as dance. Experimenting with drugs, sex, and free-form lifestyles has taken its toll on everyone, especially Sal and Dean, who lose control in a Mexican brothel. I’m assuming your direction here was inspired by convulsions and seizures—involuntary movements more akin to electrocution than expressive movement. Absent of all form, their wild gesticulations reflect their new place in society: outsiders who have pushed their personal boundaries so far that they’re now physically and philosophically lost. I found great inspiration in this crescendo of movement. The script’s pacing is not always as graceful, but road movies seldom are. The genre demands that characters rotate dance partners every few miles, and here we have memorable appearances by Viggo Mortensen, Amy Adams, Kirsten Dunst, Steve Buscemi, and many others. While none of them make the final curtain call, I think everyone deserves to take a modest bow. It was, after all, a very unorthodox beat you were forced to follow.

Lussier, Editors, You guys must be close pals by now. Just last year you worked together in the editorial departments of Steven Spielberg’s The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse alongside the legendary Michael Kahn, his longtime collaborator. So, having now seen Piranha 3DD, the film you both edited, I’m curious: which of the lessons you learned from working in such intimate proximity to one of the most significant editor/director partnerships of all time did you apply when you started stitching together the footage for Piranha 3DD? Maybe one of the lessons was: recognize the value of the individual pieces. David Koechner and Paul Scheer both bring strong comedy credentials; Christopher Lloyd and Gary Busey bring some manic B-movie gravitas; even David Hasselhoff shows up in a pleasantly self-deprecating mood. And, of course, lots of tits. Hours and hours of footage of tits: at rest and in motion, up close and afar, dripping with water, dripping with blood. Unfortunately for you, the sum of these individual pieces, in execution, is less than whole: Koechner is resurrecting a half-wit ghost of Champ Kind, Scheer is just as diaphanous, Lloyd and Busey are given woefully little to do, and Hasselhoff, when he shows up, seems to be performing in his own private version of The Kentucky Fried Movie. Only the tits live up to expectations, moving the plot forward in ways that no performer or scene or line of dialogue seems able to: there’s an adult-themed waterpark, some piranhas left over from the first film, and despite the best efforts of our beautiful, bland, forgettable protagonists, the twain shall meet. That’s not much, but it’s enough. Dare imagine what Spielberg and Kahn could have made out of it (or maybe Verna Fields). But one gets the sense that Piranha 3DD was shot sequentially, and, as time passed, the filmmakers quit caring altogether and improvised entire shooting days with random sight gags, non sequitur exchanges of dialogue, and reams of B-roll that looks like camcorder footage of someone’s filthy fish tank. And thank God for that second unit, am I right? Without them – and with the murky footage of that one underwater plant to pad the transitions from scene to pointless scene – there would be no movie. The official running time is 83 minutes, but at least 15 minutes of that is the epic, interminable end credit sequence. Part epilogue, part blooper reel, part deleted scenes, part making-of featurette—you guys took all the future DVD extras and assembled them into a circuitous David Lynch-ian nightmare sequence. In a way, it’s the best part of the movie. In another, more accurate way, it’s the worst. It’s also a pretty perfect summation of the movie as a whole: a lot of different things happening at the same time, with no cadence and no momentum to unite them, all set to a soundtrack of contemporary tunes that sounds like a compilation of the worst late-90s alt-rock. I think I know what you guys were going for. You were trying to make a subversive, self-referential, self-aware horror flick that indulges all those frat-boy fantasies about big boobs and sharp knives while at the same time, with a knowing sneer, observing it all from a distance. Right? Something like that? A version of Cabin in the Woods for readers of Maxim and watchers of Manswers. And I guess you partially succeeded, because, in a way, Piranha 3DD is like Cabin in the Woods. Except with the cleverness-to-breast ratio reversed. So, what lessons did you apply from your internship with the most popular director of all time and his unsung architect? Clearly, it was this: when all else fails, cut to a close up of bouncing tits.

Yet as “the Producer of Alice in Wonderland”, you’ve given yourself top billing in the Snow White and the Huntsman ad campaign. What a lame way to promote this bold and striking re-imagining of a classic fairy tale. Was there really no one on the crew you could have used to align the film with its true inspiration, Lord of the Rings? Why not instead advertise that you have three-time Academy Award winner Colleen Atwood on board, who out-does her previous costume designs in this film and is a slam-dunk for Oscar number four?  Or Andrew Ackland-Snow, who also art directed every one of the Harry Potter films? The man even has “Snow” in his name, dammit! Stretch it even farther if you have to: From the Storyboard Artist of The Dark Knight From the Armory Coordinator of War Horse From the Archery Coach for Robin Hood All these are equally true, plus they are the types of films you’re better off comparing yourself to. And frankly, this Snow White is more at home in this company than with that prissy Alice. Walt Disney immortalized the fairy tale by making her the first in a long line of princesses who could talk to animals and get rescued by handsome princes. In this beautifully shot non-Disney reboot, you’ve given Snow White some guts and agency, turning her escape from captivity and building of an army into a Joan of Arc tale. Using a bankable property is a smart bait and switch strategy, but you still might not catch all the audience you could have for this film unless you find a better way to get the word out. As you know, people only really care about what the actors or director will bring to a project. You’ve got the Twilight vote all locked up by putting Kristen Stewart’s face on all the ads as the iron-clad hero-to-be. She tries admirably in the film, and looks better than she probably ever has on screen. Only problem is she still struggles mightily when trying to bring more than one emotion to the surface at a time. She could learn a few things from Charlize Theron who plays Ravenna, the evil queen, and has both dramatic depth and beauty to spare. You’re real gamble, however, was going with first-time filmmaker Rupert Sanders. Full credit goes to you for putting together this ambitious big budget film with a completely unknown director. Hard to promote the fact he cut his fantasy chops on Monster.com and Axe deodorant commercials. The latter, at least, is evidence the man knows sexy. Even his kick-ass Call of Duty: Black Ops spot opens with a drop dead gorgeous woman yielding an M:16 and a power suit. Sanders manages to bring that bravado to the project, without ever falling into brainless Sucker Punch territory. Fact is, most people don’t even know what a producer does. And unlike other positions, every producer defines his or her job differently. There are the studio stooges, looking after the budget, the creative partners who get into the thick of every decision, and even honorific titles given to people who help the film get made from the early stages.  Someone with your heavy-hitting background, having directed Christmas with the Kranks and Revenge of the Nerds II, clearly focuses on creative. So come clean about where it came from. Evan Daughtery, who wrote Snow White and the Huntsman as a spec script a decade ago, has no problem admitting his influence. Other films say they are “inspired by a true story” even when they bare next to no resemblance from the original source material. Why not just say “Inspired by a Peter Jackson trilogy” and get it over with? You must have used something similar in boardrooms. The rest of the world might as well hear it: Snow White is a sexier version of Frodo. Ravenna is a way sexier version of Saruman. Two cute fairies replace the ugly Gollum. Legolas is the prince. The Huntsman is Aragorn with better billing. And screw those other useless Hobbits, we’ve got seven fighting dwarfs. See, how easy that was?

I’m not just talking about your sets, which do a great job of contrasting social clashes that are key to Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano’s feature film, but also the depth of talent on display. Even more impressive is how this unlikely tale has translated into one of the biggest box-office hits in European history. In one sense, I could argue your task was easy. It doesn’t take much imagination to contrast the lives of a poor African immigrant, played brilliantly by Omar Sy, with an out-of-touch French bourgeois portrayed by François Cluzet, whom he’s tasked with caring for. As an audience, we’ve been here, seen that before. Yet the results are rarely ever this satisfying. The basic set pieces on screen feel like they came from a pawn shop of Hollywood clichés: a poor, uneducated free-spirit, a rich, up-tight enfant gate, and a journey through melancholy to rediscover purpose and love. Disney has been using this formula for ages. They’ve just never made it a platonic love story between a street thug and a wealthy quadriplegic. Together, you’ve built a world we at once recognize, sympathize with, and envy. You make it easy to share Sy’s joy as we see him soaking up his new gold-plated bathroom only days after he seemed doomed to the indignity of bathing in a housing project full of needy children. Moments of spontaneity also help lock us into place, like the brilliant flash-forward opening sequence. We see the unorthodox relationship bloom as the two race through Parisien streets. We get hooked, and care about where this story is going, even if we’ve been there before. The result is funny, touching, and a breath of fresh air. In other words, you and your team really classed up the joint – even when it was filled with prostitutes and actual joints. A bientot!

It’s also a movie review. That’s what we do here: write movie reviews in the form of personal correspondence. I’m about to review Prometheus, the film that you both co-wrote. I was disappointed by it. Mostly because of your screenplay. It’s a screenplay that, unfortunately, doesn’t mince words. See, sometimes words need to be minced. Or else you end up with something like this: a letter that is a movie review that is written exclusively as exposition and is therefore interminable to sit through. Let me get this straight…you were hired to write the screenplay for Prometheus, the not-quite-a-prequel prequel to Alien, which would be Ridley Scott’s decades-late return to sci-fi, the genre that launched his career – who, despite recent evidence to the contrary (see Robin Hood), still possesses the craftsmanship to conjure beautiful and coherent big-screen spectacle – and the best you could do for him was to construct a generic scientific-mission-in-space-gone-wrong plot around philosophical questions about the origin of mankind that seem lifted straight from the term paper of a precocious junior high school kid? Hold on a second. You’re telling me…that you have at your disposal a willing crew of A-list actors, including Noomi Rapace, Idris Elba, Charlize Theron, and Michael Fassbender (who figuratively – then literally – channels Peter O’Toole), and you’re able to do nothing more than reduce them all to attractive exposition delivery devices who constantly describe what his happening onscreen (often while it is happening) and are motivated only by the conveniences of the plot? Okay, I think I’ve figured it out…you don’t trust the audience. Or maybe you didn’t trust Ridley Scott, in his advanced age, to tell a lucid story with his images. Why else, when Fassbender obscures his video feed from Charlize Theron’s corporate overseer, thereby cutting her off from the sortie to the alien ruins, does she proclaim indignantly to the empty room: “That bastard; he cut me off.” And why, long after the audience has discovered that a certain character has secretly been on the ship the whole time, another character observes, in a moment of redundant epiphany: “You’ve been here on the ship the whole time!” These lines, and countless others like them, are self-conscious footnotes. They are clearly coming from you, the writers, the architects of the story. It’s like you formatted the screenplay in reverse and Ridley Scott filmed the dialogue and had the actors speak the scene descriptions. It’s that famous writerly advice expressed in antithesis: telling, not showing. You want to know why I’m being so hard on you guys?…because there are some truly great moments in Prometheus. Potentially iconic moments. But it’s telling, don’t you think, that the film’s most captivating sequences are the ones that occur in silence: the magnificent opening credits sequence, the ensuing extraterrestrial sacrifice ritual, and, shortly thereafter, David bicycling through the silent space-cruiser, studying ancient languages and shooting hoops. It’s telling, too, that these moments occur in the first half of the film; the assembled talent – from the impeccable production design to the breathtaking digital cinematography – are able to disguise the incompetency of your screenplay for only so long. So, in case you didn’t get it, let me explain…you’ve written one of the most visually stunning radio plays I’ve ever had the pleasure of watching—and the misfortune of listening to. You leave a lot of questions unanswered, and not in the good, 2001: A Space Odyssey kind of way. I get the feeling this open-endedness was meant to elicit debate, but, unfortunately, the only debates to be had are about the gaping holes in logic. I’ll tell you what you did wrong…you wrote a whole lot of dialogue that begins with “Let me get this straight…” and  “So what you’re telling me is…” and other rhetorical qualifiers, and while it might do wonders to explain the mechanics of the narrative, it does nothing to impel the characters, humanize them, or provide any insight into the mess of pseudo-profound musings you implant, like so many stillborn xenomorph fetuses, into their chest cavities—which remain, I was disappointed to observe, thoroughly unexploded.  This is the part where the letter ends, Jared Status: return to sender (2/5)"},{"title":"The Hospital","url":"/2012/06/14/the-hospital","date":"2012-06-14 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Howard Gottfried, Producer You, sir, must be a fighter. To make a movie this challenging must have demanded repeated boxing and wrestling matches. Perhaps not even just verbal ones. Writer Paddy Chaefsky and actor George C. Scott are at the height of their powers here, and it couldn’t have been easy to contain them. Any production as large as a movie requires compromises, but when it comes to the script and performances in The Hospital, I can detect none.  The result is that even now, 40 years later, this movie kicks the crap out of me and anything that I dared to hold sacred but unexamined. Through Scott’s character, Dr. Herbert Bock, and his unnamed hospital, it throws punches at everything in the proverbial room - gender relations, race movements, pacifists, America, optimism, pessimism, striving, and even the idea of just giving up. In one of my favourite scenes, a drunken Bock essentially picks up the entire edifice of modern medicine by the balls and bellows into its face: We can practically clone people like carrots, and half the kids in this ghetto haven’t even been inoculated for polio. We have established the most enormous medical entity ever conceived, and people are sicker than ever. We cure nothing! We heal nothing! The whole goddamned wretched world, strangulating in front of our eyes. The critique is powerful, accurate, and like Network, sadly contemporary. In fact, the issues that inspired Chaefsky are even more true now, if you look at the corruption of the both healthcare industry and the larger political sphere by powerful and cynical moneyed interests. The villains in this old 70s movie are our villains today. Even if the message’s delivery seems at times a little overwrought, it’s because the subject demands such treatment. Maybe it wasn’t that hard of a fight; a story like this might have just sold itself. The story itself is nicely contained. It follows Dr. Herbert Bock through two days of his life. He is brilliant, and angry. There is a murder mystery. There are politics. There is a fiery romance. But with Chaefsky writing the actual words that the characters deliver, The Hospital is elevated to a compelling polemic that you don’t want to end. I don’t know who would risk making a movie like this today. It must have cost you a lot personally, and you must have had more than one second thought. I’ve read that when Chayefsky was later diagnosed with cancer, he refused surgery, claiming that he “feared retribution by the doctors” for his portrayal of Bock in the film. He died just a year later at the age of 58. That may be the price of fighting the good fight, and fighting it well.

You did sleek close-crops and comb-overs for Mad Men. You did space-siren curls and post-grunge cheerleader-chic for Joss Whedon’s Serenity and Buffy. With some oh-so-carefully-applied gel, you convinced the world Val Kilmer was gay in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. And then, well, you did Killers. If there’s hair, you can go there. And – Judas Priest! – does Rock of Ages have hair! Lots of it. It flows and falls and curls and folds in clichéd, sexy, weird, and even funny ways—all in that order, perfectly echoing the most frequent elements of the movie (also in that same order). Even better, your work supports the plot itself. When the two lovers, played by Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta, fall out with each other and lose themselves, you show it in their locks. When Hough’s Sherrie Christian is preparing excitedly for her hot date, her hair is distinctly – and authentically – erect. When Alec Baldwin needs to be gruff and intimidating (which is nigh impossible when you’re prancing and singing the whole time), your hairstyle tells me the story. There isn’t much time for exposition between ballads (I think more words are sung than spoken), but your hairstyles unobtrusively kept me on track. Imagine if you had worked on Prometheus. Your craftsmanship even makes up for the mistakes of others. The cinematography is sometimes messy, as if it were actually filmed in a dark, cramped music venue; people’s heads always popping into the frame, the angles constrained. The only way I recognized some characters is by curly blond or hairspray brunette. Even with such faults, it’s hard for me to dislike a musical. They play by different rules and carry a necessarily lighter load. Here is a love story, lots of sincerity, a peppering of wry wit, beautiful people, and song and dance. The rest is a grab bag of eternal themes that help pass the time: love vs. trust, greed vs. authenticity, sexual expression vs. repression, innocence vs. experience, hypocrisy vs. itself, and Tom Cruise’s penis vs. everyone. Somehow, it all adds up. Even though it’s a little lame, Rock of Ages is still a pleasure. My only pause is that, like your impeccable and multifaceted hairstyles, it’s all impossibly dated. The political backdrop is that of a repressed America trying to kill a form of music that threatened with its wildness and purity. It may have felt that way in 1987, but the truth is that Tipper Gore was simply scaring people for political points. Music today is so diverse and fragmented, you can see the real reason why rock was an easy target then: it was pretty homogeneous. No one cares about how controversial rock music is anymore, because no two people could even agree on what rock is. Today the truly wild stuff is happening on the edges, where genres are mixed up. But when Diego Boneta’s character leaves his rock roots for another genre, it is a betrayal, not a potential revolution. Did the filmmakers forget that Danger Mouse mixed the Beatles and Jay-Z eight years ago? What about those Beastie Boys/Led Zeppelin mashups? And that’s just the stuff that old people like me know about. We live in far more interesting times, musically, than the movie’s characters do. The problem may be that the movie doesn’t really take music seriously—which is strange for a musical about music. Perhaps musicals are best when they are about gangsters, war, cowboys, or Mormons—distinctly unmusical things. Cabaret wasn’t actually about the cabaret. A musical about music may be a fundamentally compromised premise. It can only turn inward to indulge fantasy instead of connecting with the outside world  So, it’s a little dumb. But: fun! There are other places to go if you are really into music. Or really good singing. This one has a drunken baboon and a bare-chested Tom Cruise and some strippers and a Brian Cranston that all show their asses. There is KISS and Bon Jovi and REO Speedwagon. The romantic couples are cute. The ladies, hot. Everyone sings, even if they actually can’t. Alec Baldwin is adorable. Paul Giamatti is adorable. Russell Brand was a little tame, but that is probably a good thing. This movie is a tribute to fun that just happens to be in the house of rock.

Tell me if they seem significant. 3, 14, 19, 10. No, it’s not a list of scene numbers for you to keep track of. Nor is it a secret code that has to be punched into an underground supercomputer to keep the world from exploding, or the cipher that reveals the true historical birthplace of Jesus Christ. These are, in chronological order, the Rotten Tomatoes scores for your last four films. I don’t think either of us will be surprised when the critical consensus for That’s My Boy continues the trend. As script supervisor, I realize that you’re responsible for the continuity, not creativity, of what happens onscreen. What you do is really for the benefit of the production schedule: you make sure that details aren’t missed, that coverage is covered, that scenes make sense so that everyone can move on to shoot the next one. But you must also feel some small bit of pride about the finished product, the actual film, the palpable outcome of all those days on the set. After all, it’s sent out to the world with your name on it. In the case of That’s My Boy, the finished product is the story of B-level celebrity Donny Berger (Sandler) trying to reunite with his long-lost son (a painfully restrained Andy Samberg). Along the way, we get to see: a twelve year-old boy having sex with a grown woman, an obese stripper’s scarred and swollen breasts, a character shitting his pants, copious amounts of masturbation (in bed, in a back alley, in a strip-club locker), characters getting slimed with semen, a character unknowingly eating semen, an elderly woman having sex with Vanilla Ice, and a very important act of incest (the denouement hinges on it). The raunch isn’t the point. When it’s done well, raunch is sublime (you know all about that from working on Superbad). But this is a film that gives up completely on being a film. It shrugs off its own narrative, betrays its own characters, mistimes its own jokes, and double-crosses anyone who dares suspend their belief. It gives up on the audience the same way, I worry, that you’ve given up caring about what films you work on. Now, I don’t mean for this letter to be censorious. What I wanted to talk to you about was your larger body of work. Before you fell into the putrid morass that is the post-millennium Adam Sandler oeuvre, you worked on Terry Zwigoff’s brilliant Ghost World. When you went mainstream, you did it admirably: Girl Interrupted, Legally Blonde, the Austin Powers films (everyone forgets what a surprise the first one was). Even the early scripts that you guided through production – I’m talking American Ninja and Missing in Action III – held a sort of esteem among genre enthusiasts; it must have felt good, one some level, to sate their desires for roundhouse kicks and exploding machine-gun towers, to make sense of it all.  Maybe you need a little break from the Happy Madison crew. Maybe seek out a smaller film to work on. Or a younger, greener filmmaker to work with. Something – anything – that might allow you to put to better use the considerable on-set experience you’ve acquired. Wouldn’t it be nice to impel, with your supervision, a film that aims for something higher than a shot to the groin?  But, hey, in this economy you have to take what you can get, right?

Of course, that hasn’t stopped the hype machine from taking advantage of your contributions. Pixar’s first female lead! Pixar’s first female director! But now, with some version of your ginger warrior finally reaching the screen, I can’t help but wonder if Brave might have ironed out some of its kinks by sticking to a bold, singular vision. The biggest (and best) parts of Brave tell the story of Merida (Kelly MacDonald), a willful, self-confident princess in medieval Scotland, and her relationship with her very proper mother (Emma Thompson).  Merida doesn’t want a life dictated by protocol and what it means to be a lady in waiting; she yearns to break free of everything her mother represents. After tensions reach a breaking, she does just that, fleeing the kingdom, igniting tensions between the various clans that have come to compete for her hand in marriage. What happens next between mother and daughter is the heart of the film, and even with its fantastical elements (including wisps, witches, and spell gone wrong), it’s handled with the nuance and attention to character that I’ve come to expect from Pixar.  However, this film comes from two very different sensibilities, and has two distinct, discordant voices. One comes from a tradition centered on character, emotion and organic storytelling. The other, well that one comes from the Pixar who made Cars. And here is where I wonder if your voice got lost. This other part of the film, for lack of a better term, I’ll simply call shenanigans. Characters who are always doing something crazy (and noisy); scenes ending in a cavalcade of slapstick (and noise), whether it’s appropriate to the tone or not (did I mention the noise?). These aren’t constructed jokes, with an intricate build up and payoff. No, they’re just noise that made me think some of those involved didn’t trust the story enough to hold an audience’s attention on its own. I was disheartened to see this element smash its way into the film because in a setting this rich, with animation this gorgeous, I was happy to just luxuriate in the environment. I didn’t want my attention diverted every 30 seconds. The film was, from the beginning, in such a hurry to be funny before anything else, I had to actively work against what I was watching to enjoy the film. It’s pretty much the opposite of the early scenes in Up. I also couldn’t help but notice that one of your two co-directors, Steve Purcell, had a story credit on Cars (as he does here). Does he represent the part of the Pixar story machine that’s uneasy about crafting a film that’s too, dare I say, girly? I don’t mean to use that as a pejorative, I’m simply trying to find a reason for these shifts in tone. If both Up and WALL-E could spend large chunks of their first acts in near silence, slowly integrating the audience into their worlds, why does Brave need to try so hard? I’d hate to think that Pixar—responsible for bringing so many of Hayayo Miazaki’s strong female leads to North American audiences—would turn out to feel more at home with Mater than Merida. Thankfully, though, most of this forced wackiness is in the early parts of the film, and things do eventually settle down into a moving, character-driven tale. Even though you’re listed as one of three directors and one of three scriptwriters, you have the sole story credit. And it’s that story’s heartbeat that can be heard clearly through all the added noise and fury, making Brave such a satisfying experience.

I kept waiting for that dramatic turnaround, or masterful embrace of at least one of the many available plot points. I felt sure something would make your awkward role fall into place. But no. You stayed pretty but awkward, and so did the whole movie. I didn’t have high expectations, really. Maybe you could call them big. I expected big Oliver Stoney violence and sex and drugs and all those fun summer things that could make this a sort of more mature version of Natural Born Killers. I didn’t know anything about you, but the rest of the cast looked so promising. And for the most part, they brought it. Benicio del Toro as a psychopath and John Travolta as a crooked DEA agent are great! The leading dudes, Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson certainly looked ripped and rarin’ to be awesome. Salma Hayek was game to be an evil drug kingpin with a secret soft side. Even you come across as a plausibly laid-back centre – the lover, the victim, the confidante – to what should be a whirling nexus of ass-kicking and mind-blowing. All the people were in place.  So one of two things failed: the Script, or the Stone. It could have been the script: the narration - your narration - was such a constant and heavy presence, introducing everyone, establishing distracting details and even undoing the whole climax of the first act.  Maybe there was no coming back from that. Or, it could have been the fault of director Oliver Stone, who probably gets free reign on the movies he’s making, and he hasn’t made a good one recently. The things he seems interested in are not the things the characters or the audience really care about. So maybe he just fit the story elements together in a compelling way, and no one felt they could point that out to him. A quick look for a review of Don Winslow’s original novel tells me that it was probably the director’s fault.   We have an ongoing discussion here at DCAC about how it is hard to make a truly bad big budget movie nowadays. There are enough professionals on hand for each one, that most of the time the worst they get are “meh”. You have to go to small movies to see the spectacular messes like The Room. Yet in The Savages there were a few moments where the audience laughed that were not supposed to be funny. And a few lines that were supposed to be funny (I think…again, awkward) made about a dozen strangers groan out loud. But that balances with some pretty exciting action sequences and some pretty fun performances. Don’t be too mad. This isn’t a bad movie at all. It just should have been much, much better, or at least more fun. Maybe you should be mad. You’re so pretty when you’re mad. Ready and Forgiving, Cory (3.5/5) Air Mail P.S. I also wonder how you felt when you saw the term “wargasm” among your opening lines. Just. Ugh right?"},{"title":"The Amazing Spider-Man","url":"/2012/07/06/the-amazing-spider-man","date":"2012-07-06 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear James Horner, Composer I’ve followed your career for a long time, and felt a need to write to you after seeing The Amazing Spider-Man. I’m aware of the charges (not without merit) that have been leveled against you, the most common being that that you often plagiarize your own music. So when the closing credits rolled, I was honestly shocked to see your name appear. Not because this score sounded nothing like your previous work, but because it sounded so … uninspired. I’ll give credit where it’s due: your score certainly captured the film’s essence. Film scoring is a tough gig. Music is usually left until the last few weeks of postproduction, and with deadlines looming, reaching into a familiar bag of tricks can be the only recourse. But when you stop recycling your own compositions, and instead pillage the same library of tricks used by every hack composer of the last century, there’s something else going on. And to be clear, the movie itself does the same thing. All the expected bits are there in the plot: nerdy high school student Peter Parker (a twitchy Andrew Garfield) is bitten by form of super-spider, gains said super powers, falls in love with the girl (Emma Stone, representing the possible acme of nerd dreamgirls), and fights a super-villain (Rhys Ifans being the boring sort of British). Some of the names have been changed, but it was all there in Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man back in 2002. Raimi brought a lively pop zing to his telling, though, which is what happens when a story is being told fresh, and not simply retold.  Even the ‘new’ elements added to the story feel old. Opening with the back-story of Peter’s parents feels a little too much like Batman Begins. Ditto on the ‘edgier, darker’ tone (quotes added because I’m pretty sure some Sony executive said those exact words).  Unlike Christopher Nolan’s interpretation of dark, director Marc Webb give us more of a very light gray. This is not a Peter Parker that teeters on losing himself to violent or hateful impulses. No, this is a Peter Parker that has a skateboard. I wracked my brain to remember the last time a skateboard was associated with edgy, and all I could come up with is Poochie. (I’d also have offered Marty McFly as an example, but he actually was cool.) In this light, I could chalk up the fact that you didn’t reuse Danny Elfman’s original Spider-Man score as some sort of artistic triumph. But instead, did you really have to rip off a host of tired genre clichés? To be fair, if I was asked to create music for something so obviously written by a (very out of touch—I still can’t get past that skateboard) committee, I’d probably use the same generic horror movie stings, somber boy-sopranos, and randomly-placed crescendos you did *.  This is a score so familiar, one could be forgiven for not noticing it. I might not have even known this film had music if the credits weren’t so insistent in telling me you scored it. But maybe I can give you a pass here. If the rest of the creative powers involved weren’t trying very hard, why should you? Uninspired, obligatory, and most of all unnecessary: your score really does capture all of these; and since that so closely matches my feeling about the film, I guess … success?  With great responsibility, Casey Status: Standard delivery (2.5/5) *Which were also strangely somber. I never thought swinging though the skyline of New York could feel like such a drag.^ "},{"title":"Moonrise Kingdom","url":"/2012/07/12/moonrise-kingdom","date":"2012-07-12 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Lee Wimer, Color Timer, For someone like you, who has overseen the color correction for nearly 200 films, a Wes Anderson project must be the ultimate gig. No other filmmaker so painstakingly composes the colors in every shot and so faithfully adheres to his own strict aesthetic code. Yet critics can be pretty black and white when discussing Anderson – either he’s praised as a peerless American auteur or dismissed as a one-trick pony.  I’m caught in the middle, believing he’s a hit-or-miss director that often struggles to express shades of grey. But when his films work, his colorful characters and palettes can come together as near-perfect cinematic compositions. And Moonrise Kingdom is the best expression of his talents yet. Anderson was born to tell a children’s story. The Fantastic Mr. Fox brought him into that realm, but his visual signature felt conventionally artificial in stop-motion animation. Moonrise Kingdom allows him, for the first-time, to put children at the center and let us experience their storybook understanding of the world. Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand and (of course) Bill Murray may be the headliners, but newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward are the emotional center which all the other performances must be adjusted against. In the language of your work, they are the flesh-line and the white balance.  And because the characters are drawn more than skin-deep, the whole movie succeeds. Set on a remote island in 1960s New England, twelve-year-old Sam Shakusky (Gilman) escapes from the strict regime of the Khaki Scouts and joins an emotionally disturbed but lovelorn Suzy Bishop (Hayward) in a journey that will test the survival skills of their budding romance. We believe their childish sincerity, which keeps the comedy fresh instead of contrived. The vivid and artificial define a lot of what we see on screen, but with the exception of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, the calculated character portraits have never felt more appropriate. The anal-retentive scouts are a perfect foil for meticulously campy art direction. There are also moments where the dark tones are more pronounced than I would expect. Not just the nighttime climax in monochromatic blue, or catalyst phone call in overpowering yellows, but in the subtle approach to violence and sexuality.  Sure the treatment is comparatively harmless, but relative to a child’s experience, these moments are illustrated as important highlights and lowlights that provide a refreshing range of experiences. So if you, like me, were worried that Anderson may have already over-saturated his own formula, breathe easy. There’s gold at the end of this rainbow.   With flying colors, Christopher Status: Priority Post (4.5/5) "},{"title":"Madman","url":"/2012/07/13/madman","date":"2012-07-13 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Welcome to Dear Cast & Crew’s summer film series, in which we    write letters home from some of the goriest, bloodiest, throat-slashiest    summer camps in film history. Letters from Slasher Camp: Dear Richard W. Haines, Sound Effects Editor, A silhouetted figure stares down at the blissfully unaware camp counselors during the prerequisite “let’s all gather around the campfire and tell scary stories about the guy who will be ripping us apart in the next ten minutes” scene. And your haunting soundscape ignites our imagination with what grisly horrors await Madman Marz’s victims. We get so much with so little! It’s too bad the rest of the film fails to live up this early tone of dread and unease. This is also one of the few times we actually see Marz. His time onscreen is fairly limited, which doesn’t give him much of a chance to establish any sort of personality compared to the other genre icons near and dear to our hearts. However, due mainly to your very effective use of sound, we don’t need to see him. The heavy, labored breathing you laid over the POV shots, along with the animalistic shrieks and growls that punctuate the gory set pieces, means Marz nonetheless becomes a madman to be feared. (Drinking game: take a shot every time I write the word “madman”!) Your sound effects also impressed me in the flashback of a hulking farmer inexplicably slaughtering his family. Given the subject matter – young children being slaughtered – it could have easily dragged the film into the territory of nasty, needless exploitation. But the way the violence is tastefully toned down, mostly implied by the sound effects of the killer’s booming footfalls, make this entire sequence incredibly unnerving. Let me tell you, Richard, it rattled in my head long after seeing it. Other times, the violence gloriously explodes in front of us, like when a character peers underneath the hood of his car, only to have Marz bounce off the hood with a thundering metal drumbeat and decapitates him. It perfectly sets up the next payoff, in which another character wonders why the car won’t start and quickly finds out it’s because “AHHHHHHHHH there’s a severed head stuck in the engine!” But, here’s where Joe Giannone’s script and direction let you down.  When Marz isn’t a) stalking the counselors, or b) performing lethal spinal enhancements (I’m better off not knowing which foley effect you used for that one), there isn’t really a heck of a lot for you to do. I realize we’re talking about a teensploitation slasher film, but it still might have been nice to see a narrative more complex and interesting than: character A and his fantastically huge belt buckle going off into woods, disappearing, is searched for by character B, who, after meeting his maker, is searched for by character C…and so on and so forth. That standard sort of plot structure can work, sometimes. But not when every character is a screaming bore and so completely devoid of personality that you’re checking your watch every ten seconds, wondering why they aren’t being dispatched by the resident madman (drink!).  I don’t need profound character drama, but anything that might have made these people more likeable and interesting (a personality, say, or a motivation more complex than the desire to reproduce) would have been greatly appreciated. It’s the cardinal rule of horror films: if you can’t bring yourself to care about the characters and what may happen to them, there’s little suspense to be had. They become nothing more than meat for the grinder.  Oh, and one last thing: I’m not sure if you played part in the toe-tapping bluegrass tune that closes out the film, but it was truly inspired, and I’ve been humming it for days now.  Bloodthirsty maniacs definitely need their own theme songs.  Sincerely, Kelan Young Status: Standard Delivery (3/5) "},{"title":"Ted","url":"/2012/07/16/ted","date":"2012-07-16 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Kristen Borges, Fur Groomer, I promise right now to not refer to you as Ted’s official fluffer. That would be very demeaning to your profession. And childish of me. There’s just no room for that kind of language in a serious film review. Plus, you probably were defluffing half the time. Like combing Ted’s teddy hair just right for the practical shots. Cleaning away the smell of marijuana and powdery traces of cocaine. Wiping off chocolate from his mouth after simulating oral sex with a Fudgesicle. Washing out hand-lotion that was mock semen from a gang-bang. Besides, we’re told multiple times that, despite his rabid libido, Ted doesn’t have a cock to fluff anyway. I mean penis. Fuck! Shit! Comedy! Alright, now that we have that out of our system, let’s look at what else you were working with. First off, it must have been nice to brush up against a pop culture icon in his feature film debut. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane is the writer, director, producer, (voice)-actor and all-around appeal of this R-rated comedy. Sure it has moments of shit-on-the-floor raunchiness, but pushing boundaries in film is a lot harder than on network TV, where the Griffins have been living on the edge for better part of a decade. Here the muzzle is finally taken off, and what we get is a tough-talking teddy bear that still needs to cuddle. This sets up some warm and fuzzy moments early on, when the film is probably at its best, but still struggles to find a real heartbeat in an otherwise painfully conventional romantic comedy. Mark Walhberg, who wishes Ted to life as a child, is certainly not an obvious choice for the pot-smoking slacker he’s playing. But if you can suspend your disbelief that his muscles just sort of aren’t there, he does have a knack for playing a doe-eyed dumbass. And it doesn’t take much imagination for any guy to believe the perfectly groomed Mila Kunis is “the one”, but like most male-dominated comedies, her girlfriend character is ultimately just a wet blanket for the fun. This kind of formula is actually defluffing me. Even Ted himself starts to fall apart by the end of the film. His once fluffy coat becomes worn and patched as he wears out his cuteness. These are nice deliberate touches, but was MacFarlane really this self-aware of the effect the bear is having on the audience? We do know he loves his post-modern references: the joke “there’s no way I sound that much like Peter Griffin” is funny, but pointing out that Ryan Reynolds (in a bit part) looks like Van Wilder is just lazy. And of course, like all modern comedies, we seem to need to resurrect some forgotten 80s star.  This time it’s Sam J. Jones, a.k.a. Flash Gordon, whose fair blonde hair you undoubtedly were tasked with grooming as well. It’s just another trope in a comedy that, on the surface, looks original, but underneath is as conventional as they come. Although it’s a bit tedious, Ted the film luckily isn’t a bore. It might be stuffed with a lot of clichés, but at least you kept that outside coat nice and shinny to draw us in. Fur-ever yours, Christopher Status: Standard Delivery (2.5/5)"},{"title":"Cosmopolis","url":"/2012/07/17/cosmopolis","date":"2012-07-17 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Archie Rodrigues, Travel Agent Maybe you can help me understand where David Cronenberg’s career is going. Sure, you’re probably booking his tickets to Cannes, Venice, and other prestigious film festivals, but onscreen he seems to be stuck. He’s in the top 1% of his class, making decisions that are both bold and pointless, while calmly circulating with a gang of elite peers trying to get on board with him. Cosmopolis, it seems, might be more of a metaphor about his own career than it is about the state of American capitalism. But you’re not in show business, you’re in the travel business. So let’s start by looking at the actors you flew in for production. Robert Pattinson is perfectly suited to play a stolid billionaire quickly losing his fortune—along with his will to live. Sarah Gadon is probably the film’s second star, based on her tangled relationship with the protagonist. But after that’s it’s a toss up: Juliette Binoche, Samantha Morton, Jay Baruchel, Matthieu Amalaric, Paul Giamatti and others all get a scene in which they try to get through to the robot-talking sociopath hell-bent on getting a haircut while the city is under lockdown. Clearly the film is trying to go somewhere more profound than that, but it takes an exhaustive route. Thematically, Cosmopolis is structured like a traditional road movie. Large portions are set in a car, and while a destination  supposedly drives the plot forward, it’s the rotating cast of characters along the way that defines the journey. But instead of sweeping landscapes and open opportunities, we get a decidedly un-cosmopolitan claustrophobic tale in a poorly-substituted New York (the opening shot in front of Union Station will take anyone familiar with the urban Toronto landscape out of the story before it even gets rolling). Keeping the city anonymous might have helped the cause, since we never see more than 20 feet out of a car window anyway.  These technical deficiencies are some of the film’s most glaring faults. For the past decade, Cronenberg has been making an unflattering move into the realm of filmed theatre. Sure, every film student studies the deep focus shots in Citizen Kane, but they involved complex compositions; here we get a lot of heads and no focal point, which gives Cosmopolis even more of a play-like sensibility than A Dangerous Method.  His uncomfortable insistence on wide-angle close-ups also could be considered distinctly cinematic, but their overuse renders them ineffective. In a nutshell, Cronenberg needs to take a break. He’s out of touch with his own talents and seems to be having some sort of late-life crisis. Please make sure when you book his next trip that he gets some time to himself. To think, to relax, to remember what he loved about filmmaking in the first place. Cosmopolis makes it clear that he needs to start spending more time in cinema seats and less on the red carpet.

Writer and director Lorene Scafaria takes a different approach, opting for ground-level vision of the apocalypse that focuses on a more intimate picture of total loss. It’s a bittersweet romantic comedy that most likely left you, as a motion picture pilot who specializes in providing sweeping views from above, feeling a little left out. Then again, it’s possible you were the inspiration for the entire film. Dodge (Steve’s Carrell) is first introduced as he learns that an impossible Michael Bay-like mission to save the planet from an oncoming asteroid has failed. His stupefied wife, who’s also in the car, immediately abandons him and never looks back. Dodge, meanwhile, carries on like an emotional zombie and tries to maintain his dismal status quo. I assume your contributions up until this point, professionally and personally, were not included. Who knows, you may have had an equivalently spectacular relationship crash this was based on, but the pathos the director is going for at this point is mainly hyperbolic. Eventually we meet Penny (Keira Knightly), a British ex-pat who missed the final flight home. This unfortunate event leads to some distinctly Knightly-esque neurotics that could only have appeared subtle from 10,000 feet above. So the twitchiest actress in Hollywood follows Hollywood’s favourite sad clown under a suspicious promise that he can help ‘aerial coordinate’ her home. See, you’re the hero! Along the way, we have a couple fun stops (like the orgy-prone restaurant Friendsy’s) and at least one pointless side trip to some survivalists that feels forced into the fold. The road trip sequence never lives up to the atmosphere in the first act, when the world is slowly falling apart around Dodge, but the film lands a smooth third act that doesn’t shy away from it’s dark premise. The plot offers just enough moments of dread to balance out the genre’s predisposition for optimism. The final view may not be as grand as a man of the skies would have liked, but for once it’s nice to see a far-fetched story stay grounded.

You bore the brunt of an unprecedented frenzy. Not only did you guard precious secrets from a rabid public, but you dealt with elaborate battle sequences involving thousands of people. With so much action on set and years of anticipation, how could you, one man, possibly keep everyone and everything safe? You can’t. That’s the reality. Even the greatest among us must have limits. We now understand that Batman is just a man and The Dark Knight Rises is just a film. And that’s okay. In fact, it’s a relief. This epic, conclusive entry to Christopher Nolan’s so-real-you-feel-it superhero saga continues to take itself very seriously. That’s what works. Most of the film seriously kicks ass. But as you know, it also means the fans will get so very serious about the whole show*. So everything needs to be handled carefully, from getting the story just right, to dealing with sneaky spies snapping photos on set. The consequence of mishandling even a small detail would have a ripple effect through both real and imagined worlds. The Internet is like an underground society that will ruthlessly claw out any vulnerable piece of information, both before and after the film comes out. So at this point, it’s time you let your guard down, and let me defend Gotham for a while. Or at least do my best. Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, Gotham is paralleling the post-9/11 experience with a Patriot Act that bears Harvey Dent’s name. Crime is down because criminals were all quickly locked up, and the city’s misunderstood protector hasn’t been seen since. Not-so-coincidentally, Bruce Wayne has transformed into a reclusive billionaire. But that can’t last when a bulging menace in a respiratory mask named Bane appears. He earns his screen cred by first one-uping The Joker’s bank robbery with a daring and spectacular aerial heist. He then retreats to his subterranean society to plot increasingly bold assaults on the city. We’re also introduced to a sexy Cat burglar, played by Anne Hathaway in a (sigh-of-relief) satisfactory performance, and gutsy police officer John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who is the heir-apparent to Commissioner Gordon’s virtue. Everyone alive in the real-world seems to affect the story in some way, plus a few more characters that are involved in delightful turns and surprises. All of Gotham City is now on trial for America’s corporate greed, and Batman is often stuck out of the suit. The final reckoning comes in waves, with more and more people taking to the streets and taking sides. We see this all unfold with unexpected visual clarity, as though Nolan actually listened to some of his critics. The average shot length in this film feels much more digestible, without sacrificing any energy. Even Bane’s auditory performance is now thankfully crystal clear (after some near disastrous sneak peeks), although it does sound a little Jeremy Irons-meets-Darth Vader. But other moments feel visually cheated, like a climactic leap of faith and arguably the mid-point face-off that essentially breaks the film in two. The full frontal street battle managed to raise my pulse, but the limitations of a PG-13 rating let me down a bit with the sanitized mayhem. Batman himself is a moral creature who avoids killing, so I accept the approach, but it also reminds me how in terms of audience terror, The Joker’s pen is mightier than the machine gun. That’s really all the eager public who harassed you wanted to know – can this film possibly live up to the previous one? Let’s put it this way –it’s a thrilling, ambitious, big-scale climax to an outstanding trilogy. The dramatic structure borrows a lot from The Dark Knight, and the story brings back many elements from Batman Begins. So the short answer is yes, it can withstand the hype, but it can’t surpass it. The overall stakes are raised, but as advertised, the legend must end.  Sincerely, Christopher Status: Priority Post (4.5/5) *Editor’s Note: We here at DC&C try to avoid the hype leading up to big movies, so that our critical eye remains sharp and our initial enthusiasm unabated.

If you didn’t have a hard enough time living down that surname in grade school, I’m guessing this cast and crew completely wore you out. Did they pretend to flatter your camera-loading skills by calling you a “master”? Or did they just stick to “Handy Andy”? Either way, I hope they didn’t hurt your feelings. When your name so easily lends itself to masturbation jokes, it’s hard to resist the obvious. And being subtle is clearly not a strong suit for the people involved in A Good Old Fashioned Orgy. That said, the premise of Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck’s adult comedy is actually treated with more regard than the title might imply. Jason Sudeikis gives us a likeable party-hard who mainly gets off by showing others a good time. When his tight group of friends, entering their early 30s, realize they’re headed different directions in life, he proposes an intimate encounter that will see their glory days go out with a bang. The month-long build up to the big event gives ample time to seduce the nay-sayers and shrink the go-getters’ firm resolve. Some rather humorous research helps the men realize that they can’t only focus on keeping up people’s spirits, if ya know what I mean. Luckily, the film does take shape at the end. Unfortunately, that doesn’t excuse some of the flaccid and predictable humour early on. A good comedy, Andy, would have had you working overtime to capture the money shot when an actor was on a roll. Tyler Labine comes closest with some over-eager moments that ring true, but other times his delivery falls flat. None of the performances feel particularly fresh, although the story at least explores its concept with more conviction than Hall Pass. And against the odds, the climax doesn’t disappoint. You can also take solace in the fact everyone has probably grown up a bit, since the film was shot in 2008 and is only now (in 2012) getting a release. That’s a long time for comedy, especially blue comedy, to be pent up. You’d think after all that anticipatory swelling, that the eventual release would have been an explosion of joy spread across the faces of America’s youth. Come on people! Doesn’t sex sell anymore?

You haven’t seen the film in its entirety (and hopefully never will), so I thought I’d tell you a bit about the movie with which, for obvious and appalling reasons, you will forever be associated. Does it live up to expectations? Of course it doesn’t. It couldn’t. Sitting in the theater last Thursday, as the impatient throng fidgeted and twitched and laughed too hard at their own jokes, I had the strange sense of having been there before, of remembering a future memory. In retrospect, I know why. From bits of hearsay and gossip, trailer clips, score samples, set photos, and two decades of reading Batman comics, I had already constructed the movie in my head. And it was perfect. Indistinct, but perfect. Or, more accurately, perfect because it was indistinct. I was set up for disappointment. At every moment the film onscreen diverged from the one I’d unconsciously contrived, I found myself bitterly unsatisfied. Which doesn’t make The Dark Knight Rises a bad movie. In fact, it’s a very good movie. Just not the one I’d been expecting. And that’s the big spoiler: for all the grittiness and verisimilitude and ripped-from-the-headlines class-warfare equivalence that Christopher Nolan brings to it, The Dark Knight Rises is still just a movie. Yes, just a movie. With actors, and props, and a musical score. A screenplay that predetermined every line of dialogue. A crew of computer artists who added false substance to it all. A craft-services table somewhere behind the camera, where, between takes, Christian Bale angled a Panini through the Bat-mask and Tom Hardy, biceps pulsing, buttered a low-fat carrot muffin. In a way, The Dark Knight Rises is disappointing solely because it exists. The tangible expression of a thing can never live up to the perfectly indistinct version one composes in forethought. And you know all about disappointment, don’t you? By all accounts, you had every opportunity to be a happy and healthy member of the human race (or at least as intermittently happy and healthy as most of us). And while I realize it’s unfair to hold such high existential expectations based only on your ethnic and socioeconomic background, I have no doubts, as a fellow middle-class white boy raised in the comfort of the suburbs, that we were born several lucky steps ahead of the roughly 15 Million children in the U.S. currently living in poverty. Unlike them, we’re not defined by what we don’t have, but by what we do: good schools, good grades, parents who were present, scholarships, degrees. Not a recipe for compos mentis, necessarily. But certainly not a recipe for mass murder.   Whether it was an insurmountable pressure to succeed, some failed secret ambition, or just a general dissatisfaction with sensory reality of day-to-day existence, it’s clear that your life didn’t turn out the way you expected it to. I’m sure you didn’t aspire to drop out of the PhD program at the University of Colorado. I’m sure you didn’t dream of being evicted from your student apartment. I’m sure, with a BS in Neuroscience in your pocket, you didn’t expect to find yourself working at McDonald’s. We all know from personal experience that the world rarely conforms to our idealistic projections of it. The exceptional life you hope to live is always imperfect in the act of actually living it. Growing older is all about the narrowing of life’s possibilities and broadening of life’s responsibilities. It’s a pretty disappointing truth, and some people deal with it better than others. Some avoid responsibility by living with their parents well into adulthood. Some fight the reductive nature of aging by refusing to commit; to a career, to marriage. And some, like you, try to exert control over fate through violent force. But as much as you hoped it would be, the cowardly act perpetrated last Thursday was no metamorphic feat. Whatever romantic disagreement is rumored to have prompted your actions surely wasn’t resolved in your favor. Whatever spree-killer hysteria you hoped to inspire has been expressed, instead, as a national debate over gun laws. Whatever infamy you hoped to gain is obscured by passing days; the world chugs relentlessly along. How disappointing for you. In the coming weeks, I’ll likely see The Dark Knight Rises a second time. I imagine it will be a lot more satisfying now that the beats and breaks and chorus are familiar enough for me to sing along. Hopefully I’ll be able to appreciate it for what it is, not for what I wanted it to be (I’ll see the film I deserve, not the one I need). You, though—you don’t get a second chance. You made your choice. Your disappointment led you to throw away any future opportunity you might have to experience the good things human beings are capable of experiencing: to love, to be loved, to be thrilled, to be surprised, to know the joyous burden of being a husband or a father, to be decent to the indecent, to show compassion for the uncompassionate, and, far down the list, to sit in a dark theater among friends and fellow geeks, absurdly excited to witness a thing as frivolous (and momentous) as a new Batman movie. Life’s small pleasures become apparent only when you accept that they occur in wholly unexpected ways. And, in that manner, they’re never disappointing. Oh, but you wanted to know how the movie ended, didn’t you? Okay, well, goodbye.

I am surprised you were required for this movie. Yours sounds like a job more befitting an historical epic or meticulous art film. You’re not just making the clothes—you’re giving everything the proper aging by hand. That has to serve a purpose. But if the rest of the movie is just going through the motions, what exactly did they need you for? In The Sitter, Jonah Hill plays Noah, a funny-but-lazyboned dropout that gets guilted into babysitting for his mom’s friend. The baby-sat kids, in this particular case, are essentially a Fox News list of top domestic threats: one is gay, one is slutty, and one is an immigrant. They exist in the movie as problems to solve, hurdles for our Noah to overcome: suburbanite versions of the ghosts from A Christmas Carol. But before he can start on that, his girlfriend Marisa (played by the hopefully-intentionally-irritating Ari Graynor) calls asking him to bring cocaine to a party in far-off Brooklyn, for which he will be rewarded with sex. Noah pathetically (but understandably) tries to do just that. Then everything goes wrong. Then it seems to get better. Then it gets even worse. I can’t deny that it’s fun. But, like the ash, abrasions, grease, blood, coke, and food stains you added to the costumes, the beats of the plot are obligatory, and since no one is really paying that much attention, just a bit unnecessary. Maybe this is just another trivial summertime outing—the fruit popsicle between meals*. I’d let that slide, if it weren’t for the walking, talking parables that are the kids. It’s not the fault of the actors—they do fine, considering what they’re given to work with. My problem is with their individual character resolutions, which show just how dangerously shallow this movie really is. Your job is so valuable because you can’t just “fix” jeans to look like the crotch has been set on fire. Hypothetically. That sort of thing takes time, and knowledge, and craft. The problems that each of the babysat kids are saddled with are so monumental, so loaded with the hopes and fears of specific segments of the American population, that it is appalling how quickly and simply they are solved. In this movie, as the audience sits cuddled in its dark movie theatre, these core and compelling challenges shared by millions of kid – and society at large – are washed away with a night of shooting, drugs, fights, fire, car crashes, screaming, and a few short monologues. And a guy burns to death. If that doesn’t creep the hell out of you, you aren’t paying attention. Sincere Regards, Cory 2/5 Return to Sender  *Though in this case, it’s a fabulous dark-chocolate-covered cherry popsicle thanks to Karl the drug dealer, played by Sam Rockwell. He always brings it to everything he does, and this case, it seems like he dropped out of an entirely different movie (dessert) just to screw with everyone.

I hope you claimed some serious overtime. Margaret was meant for release in 2007, and after legal battles and re-cuts to change the film’s length, the rest of us finally have a chance, five years, later to see Kenneth Logerman’s sophomore directorial effort. Amazingly, and against the odds, your heavy workload paid off. This film was worth the wait. And even, dare I say, worth the weight. You have to concede that as a matter of standard practice, no small-scale drama has any business stretching out to three hours. Bloated movie spectacles are sometimes given a free pass, but most audience members still cry foul.  So clearly no major studio would tolerate that runtime for a simple story about an intemperate New York girl’s struggle to deal with a horrific traffic accident. The final, non-director’s-cut version clocks in at about two and a half hours. That might sound long, but everything about this film feels just right. Well done. Oscar-winning actress Anna Paquin gives a career high performance with an infuriatingly compelling character study. From the first five minutes, in her casual exchanges with other teenagers, she sheds all the airs usually put on by too-smart teenage performances. Like Xavier Dolan’s approach in I Killed My Mother, the self-awareness is so well disguised, we’re magnetically drawn to the main character’s imbalances. She’s clearly not stupid, but definitely not as clever as she thinks. Every confident decision and emotional outburst is therefore layered with tension. It must have hurt to see anything land on your cutting room floor. And if you’re like me, you were probably also in constant agony over how much she reminded you of “someone you know”, even if that “someone” was just your general feelings about teenagers today. In fact, there’s scarcely a sour note in this entire film. Every performance, no matter how small, seems to be bringing a lifetime of understanding to their understated performances. J. Smith-Cameron, in particular, is heartbreaking as a struggling actress and mother who trying to keep it all together. So many of the other actors—Mark Ruffalo, Jean Renoir, Matthew Broderick, Allison Janney, Matt Damon—would feel like they’re making extended cameos if they weren’t so convincing and integral to adding dimensions to Paquin’s character. Even director Kenneth Logerman as the distracted but caring father has a broken cadence to his delivery that feels extremely authentic, like a classic Phillip Seymour Hoffman performance. It’s no wonder there was so much drama over the editing. The struggle was not about reducing the story to its core elements – that would be easy. It’s about ending a beautifully woven tapestry before its pattern is long enough cover every corner of the room. Dividing the film into mini-series à la Mildred Pierce might have made sense. The story doesn’t offer any false resolutions along the way, but side stories about a disoriented girl losing her virginity or political debates in the classroom create a perspective to see the complicated emotional big picture, but they do feel self-contained. And at least one extended exterior shot of Paquin’s character walking into a hazy distance already has the feeling of an episode ending, right before she decides to deal with her tragedy in damaging ways. This is easy to say now that the film is not getting a proper theatrical release anyway. But let’s focus on the positive – the film is finally out there. And sure, coordinating this backstage parade must have had some perks. You probably met Anthony Minghella, Syndey Pollack, and even Martin Scorsese who were all pulled at some point in to help edit this film. But you must be relived to finally share your work before the actors age even more noticeably, and while at least the one of those directorial legends is still alive to see the finished product. Forever yours, Christopher Status: 4.5/5 Priority Post "},{"title":"Total Recall","url":"/2012/08/03/total-recall","date":"2012-08-03 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Andy Potter, Environment Artist, Awesome work! Not just the job you had to do, but the way you did it. Your unenviable task was to take us somewhere new, based on somewhere we’ve already been. The original Total Recall (1990) with Arnold Schwarzenegger has a special place in my heart, since I was obsessed with the bulging Austrian as a child. But you did something improbable. You made me forget the original. I sat down and my mind was wiped clean, implanted with new memories. The first challenge was to create a new world when the story no longer takes us to Mars. Instead, chemical warfare has divided the surviving humans between the bourgeois island of the United Federation of Britain (formerly the U.K.) and a worker-based hellhole called The Colony (formerly Australia). The blue-collar drudge sends Douglas Quaid (Colin Ferrell) to Rekall, where fantasies can be technologically transformed into real memories. Then all hell breaks lose, and we, along with Quaid, are left constantly questioning the truth. As a visual artist, you still had to make everything feel real. You did it by grounding futuristic technology with Asian-infused decorum, all inside a densely-packed community reminiscent of Habitat 67 in Montreal. The designs are beautiful and help the film stand on its own. Other smaller details pay tribute to Paul Verhoeven’s earlier version, like a three-breasted prostitute and a misdirection that’s a fat treat for fan boys. The overall tone is not nearly as dark or adult as the original, but your team manages to one-up the visual creativity of the Fifth Element, Minority Report and even Inception. Director Len Wiseman clearly loves­—and has a talent for—staging action sequences. He saturates your elaborate environments with extended shots that embrace the unique nature of your spaces. Especially when jumping from surface to surface, away from explosions, down holes, through windows, and over whatever gets thrown in the way. Why walk or run when you can leap, right? So it all looks great, but the beauty is often only skin deep. The intricate plotting doesn’t really rattle our minds and clichés abound. For one, the film confirms my theory that the only people who lose, then recover, their memory are secret agents. And there are more artificial lens flares per frame than even J.J. Abrams would dare. But with your help, and a phsically flawless female tandem in Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale, we can easily sit back and enjoy the visual pleasures on screen. Above all else, this Total Recall succeeds because Wiseman convinced people like you to dream big. Most sci-fi films today are lucky to give us a grand total of three or four “oh cool!” moments. Total Recall impressed me with gadgetry and action scenes every three to four minutes. From glowing tattoos, to phones inside people’s hands to stomach-turning gravitational rotations, everything is designed to impress. And up until the more generic 20-minute action blowout finale, it was hard not to be. Thanks for the memories, Christopher Status: Air Mail 4/5 "},{"title":"Beasts of the Southern Wild","url":"/2012/08/08/beasts-of-the-southern-wild","date":"2012-08-08 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Jack Mannis, Pyrotechnician I’m blown away. Watching Beasts of the Southern Wild was like experiencing whistling fireworks for the first time. In the opening minutes, I focused skeptically on a tiny spark that spun and squealed, alone and aimless. But the darkness never stood a chance. You then set off an explosion of life, light, and music that sets the stage for one of the best films of the year. And you weren’t the only one who lit up the screen. There’s the little fireball named Hushpuppy (Quvenzhané Wallis), a scrappy six-year-old girl living off the coast of New Orleans on an island called The Bathtub. This landfill beyond the levies is deeper than the Deep South, and home to a stubborn society of impoverished misfits. Hushpuppy’s father Wink (Dwight Henry) is a self-proclaimed leader of the group who refuses to leave despite warnings of a major storm (Hurricane Katrina). Hushpuppy, meanwhile, believes that ancient animals called Aurochs are just coming to reclaim their home. Either way, no one is safe. Though rain and winds are the obvious threat, your fire is certainly the most versatile element of the film. In the opening party scene, it expresses joy. In the next scene, it’s played for laughs as the fiercely independent Hushpuppy lights a gas stove with a blow-torch. Then fire becomes a major threat, burning down her house and forcing her to share a trailer with her combustible father. Fire also provides comfort, letting them share an unusually quiet moment together. And at the mid-point of the film, a stick of dynamite seems ready to solve their problems, but only make matters worse. Each of these early plot points, plus a final blaze on a boat, put your pyrotechnics at the centre of the action. Amidst shaky camera work and unpolished dialogue, they help light a trail for the audience to follow.  But it’s the spirit of the film that burns brightest – an eclectic mix of Where the Wild Things Are meets One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.  Director, co-writer and composer Benh Zeitlin moves the story with a contagious rhythm that isn’t afraid to frequently warm your heart. He lets the amateur actors keep it real and keeps fantastical elements feeling grounded. The mix of narrative ingredients could have blown up in his face. But the chemistry is just right, from the affectionate ways Wink disregards his daughter’s gender (calling her “man” and saying one day she’ll be the King of the Bathtub), to the defiant first-person voiceover by a child. The big winner at Sundance 2012 and my favourite film from this year’s Festival de Cannes deserves to be celebrated. I hope you’ve got a few more fireworks handy. Boom!

And because of that, it’s easy to forgive some of the tonal missteps that occur as we go through the familiar beats and peaks towards an inevitably happy ending. But what is unforgivable, guys, is what you did to Meryl Streep’s leg.   Don’t act dumb. You know what I’m talking about. The worship of youth culture feels as though its about to hit critical mass. This is true across all medias, but particularly true in the cinema. While half a century ago it wasn’t at all strange to see a 53 year-old Cary Grant wooing 36 year-old Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember, adult audiences today are flocking to franchises like Twilight and The Hunger Games to watch handsome teens play out their romance fantasies. Which is why Hope Springs, despite focusing on matters of age and decay, feels new. Starring Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones (63 and 65, respectively), it’s the story of a woman who convinces her dour golf-obsessed husband to accompany her for a week of marital therapy in a quaint coastal village, performed by a weirdly restrained, hyper-sincere Steve Carrell, who seems to be playing an older, wiser version of Andy Stitzer from The 40 Year-Old Virgin.    Most of Streep and Jones’ marital problems involve intimacy, the treatment for which is, of course, participation in a series of increasingly X-rated sexual exercises (let’s just say it’s a great time to be alive if you’ve ever harbored a fantasy of Meryl Streep performing fellatio on you in a movie theater). All of his weirdly humiliating innuendo leads to the scene in question. A physical breakthrough. Rekindled passion. The couple is on the floor of a fancy hotel room, in front of a crackling fire, feeling each other up like a couple of teenagers in the midst of a dystopian kill-or-be-killed game show. Jones then reaches down and runs his hand up the inside of Streep’s leg. And that’s where you guys came in. Was it cellulite? Varicose veins? A tattoo of an Oscar statuette giving the middle finger? Make all the excuses you want about the corrupting nature of the institution, I don’t care if it was the studio, or producers, or director David Frankel that demanded you use your CGI skills to touch-up the inside of Miss Streep’s thigh— blotting out the scars of age in a movie that is all about those scars and how, cumulatively, they change a person, is the kind of behind-the-scenes malfeasance Hollywood is notorious for. Hope Springs has the right idea. The romantic trials of a long-married couple have the potential to be just as poignant as the high school histrionics of sparkly vampires. But the film lacks the courage of its convictions. You guys obscured the truth with your digital paintbrushes.

First you try to make us forget Arnold Schwarzenegger with a new Total Recall, and now you pull a fancypants switcheroo on Matt Damon. Nice try, Mr. “Character Rigger”, but just because you’re an expert at tampering with another writer’s original creations doesn’t mean I’ll swallow whatever you’re feeding me. I’m going to slowly, unevenly, and predictably rebel against your Hollywood mind-control program, and then give you a lot less action than expected. How do you like them oranges? The first part of The Bourne Legacy makes sure Jason The Forgetful Superspy is credited as the original problem with the government’s top secret Treadstone program. Your next trick is to run sideways with the Bourne-iverse, having the events of The Bourne Ultimatum happen in tandem with the program’s implosion in Legacy.  It’s like they say; you can take the Jason out of the Bourne movies, but you can’t take the Bourne movies out of Jason. This part is well played. The new story follows Aaron Cross, another chemically enhanced soldier, trying to avoid being wiped out when the head honchos decide to control-alt-delete their entire human experiment. But you, and they, should know that dealing with such volatile characters isn’t easy. Yet you all tinker with these soldiers and spies like they’re toys. The most improbable behavioral twist is early on when a kill code prompts a genetic scientist to murder-suicide his whole crew at gunpoint. We’ve seen far too many of these real-life meltdowns recently in the news, but a pill induced instant mental flip still feels far fetched. True motivations and consequences are compelling. Magical science that co-opts true tragedy is just lazy. Your biggest doctoring, of course, is recasting the lead with Jeremy Renner. Sure he plays a new character, but that’s a creative technicality. The audience is buying into a brand, which means we expect certain patterns and palettes to be followed. Superficially you succeed. They’re both blonde! On the other hand, Tony Gilroy (Bourne’s ongoing series screenwriter) decided as director to mostly disregard Paul Greengrass’ signature shaky-cam nausea and slow everything the hell down – but to the point you wonder if the cameraman fell asleep. Worse, there are no double-crosses, layered spy intrigue or compelling B-stories to compensate for this switch in style. Just more of the same cat-and-mouse chases and undercooked romances. Bourne’s original mission of self-discovery is simply replaced with Ward’s addiction to government pills. Adding a few smiles and quips just renders it a generic off-the-shelf offering we’ve seen before. In other words, your elaborate attempts at faceting new characters based on the old prototypes feels wasted. There’s nothing particularly wrong with The Bourne Legacy as an action/spy film, other than maybe an excessive runtime. But why water down the legacy? Sincerely, Christopher P.S.

In The Campaign it seems doubly weird that you’d pose as Dan, because he’s already playing a character that’s a parody of someone in real life. So you work as a person playing a person imitating a person that echoes a character. Is it even possible to have so many layers and not compromise them all? This comedy-cum-parody-slash-satire-plus-jingoistic heartwarmer provides the answer: “No.” But the movie takes some big risks, and I found myself rooting for it many times, even if I wasn’t laughing along as often as I’d like. The entire plot is one of stand-ins and poseurs. Your Dan Akroyd plays Wade Motch, one of the uber-Kapitalistisch billionaire brothers who start the movie pulling the political strings for Cam Brady (Will Farell), a multiple-term, lazy, corrupt senator from North Carolina. When Cam takes things too far, the Motch brothers turn to their list of potential new candidates. They select Zack Galifianakis’ Marty Huggins, an effeminate local tour guide who happens to be the son of a local political figure – a replacement for his other son­. Proving that anyone can stand in for congressional candidate, the Motch brothers send in campaign manager Dylan McDermott, whose alpha-male aggression easily transforms Marty into a successful (and wretched) American political candidate. Confused? You should be. Luckily, in The Campaign, the details don’t matter much. The film sticks to enough familiar tropes that you always know who to root for at any given moment. It’s still a neat trick, where the recurring theme is how the political machine transforms and grinds down each player in turn. Each character reveals a split identity, both betraying and being betrayed by the people he or she believes in. As characters strive heroically for their dreams and ideals, they face the true terrible costs of their behaviour.      Does that make it sound a like The Campaign has the moral gravitas of a Nolan Batman movie? Steven, you know better. Being on set must have been hilarious. Everyone seems to be having fun, and the movie’s surprises and bigger laughs feel like off-script ad-libs­. The speeches and campaign ads stand out with bits that I am sure never made it into any script, for any movie, ever. In a big summer movie—the kind that is usually focused-grouped within an inch of its life—it feels risky to leave so much to chance. But that really wasn’t the big risk of all. Your character (or the character for whose actor you stand in) has a real life version. That would be either David or Charles Koch, two gentlemen brothers actively engaged in shaping American politics from atop giant piles of money and the largest privately held corporation in the U.S. Those two are easily worth more than the entire Warner Brothers movie studio that produced this little movie. This makes the The Campaign very existence surprising ­— it spits in the eye of two American gods. I have to give it some credit for bravery. But despite the comedy and the bravery, this movie ends up having a bit of an identity crisis. Is it biting political commentary? It’s doesn’t chomp down nearly hard enough. Is it light slapstick, baby-punching silliness? The heavier themes weigh it down too much for that. Is it a soothing salve to the American consciousness that despite current troubles, everything’s going to be ok? It is way too barbed and observant to leave anyone feeling too comfortable with the world as it stands. It’s hard to see a possible fix that doesn’t require throwing the whole thing out and starting again. Risking Batman again, maybe it’s the comedy we deserve, but not the one we need.

I can’t help but regret that you weren’t the leading man in The Burning. How amazing would it be to have a young George Can’t-Stand-Ya going toe-to-toe with Cropsy, the deranged killer described in the film as having “a face like a fucking Big Mac, overdone!”? This humble little slasher was clearly your breakout role. No, I’m not being sarcastic. See, unlike so many other comic characters whose cringeworthy antics provoke not laughter but the burning desire to leap through the screen to personally hasten their demise (I’m looking at you, Shelly from Friday the 13: Part 3), you’re actually funny. The script itself isn’t remarkable, but your sense of energy and skillful comedic-timing makes it actually seem witty. It’s hard to imagine anyone else making these lines work. I’ll be honest: I expected that the hacks who penned this by-the-numbers prank-gone-wrong-creates-mutilated-killer-seeking-revenge-on-camping-teenagers screenplay would have diminished into moviemaking obscurity, but it turns out that they simply decided to focus on producing instead of screenwriting. Which has worked out well for them. But perhaps I’ll write a letter to Harvey (story by) and Bob (screenplay by) Weinstein some other time. Your character isn’t just a quip-machine, but a well-rounded, supremely likeable individual. The kind of guy willing to stand up for the kid being bullied by the camp meat-head by shooting a pellet into his ass. Which seems like something the leading man should do, right? Unfortunately, the “hero” of this piece (Brian Matthews), who I will be henceforth refer to as Final Dude (a refreshing change of pace from the slasher film trope of Final Girl) is likeable enough. He just isn’t given anything to do, and comes off pretty bland compared to you.  Unfortunately, for every nice thing I can say about you, I struggle to say anything positive about your fellow cast members. Not to say they’re all terrible—but one might expect more from a roster that includes future Oscar winners Holly Hunter and Fisher Stevens, and teen comedy character actor Brian Backer. In the climactic moment, when we should be most excited – as Final Dude races to save a fellow camper who has been abducted by Cropsy – we’re left to wish that your character was still around, providing his acerbic commentary. Even director Tony Maylam seems to be aware of this, and rushes through to the end as quickly as possible. Which is a shame, because we miss out on some highly-effective set design (the decayed remains of the camp are wonderfully creepy) and makeup effects (gruesomely revealing the full extent of the killer’s prank-induced injuries). Let me suggest something. Seeing as Hollywood has such a hard time coming up with new ideas, it’s inevitable that The Burning will eventually be remade. Starring in the remake of your very first film could be just the reboot your career needs. Just imagine an enraged George Can’t-Stand-Ya taking the fight to Cropsy in the film’s final scenes. A no holds-barred brawl of banter! Witty ripostes flying through the air like fists! I’m telling you, Jason, I could really get behind a film like that. Maybe you should get in touch with the guys who wrote the original script? Just make sure those Weinstein Brothers stick to producing and stay away from the keyboard.

First of all for narrative congruity, since the classic wood and lead scribbler plays a central role in the film. But more importantly because this Disney production is determined to take us back to the basics of storytelling. Despite all the technological tools at your team’s disposal, The Odd Life of Timothy Green is an intimate story, drawn with a light touch and a lot of care. And an unhealthy obsession with pencils. You first rough out the picture of a one-horse American town, where Jim Green (Joel Edgerton) works on the assembly line of the town’s pencil factory, while his wife Cindy (Jennifer Garner) curates the pencil museum.  The two aspiring parents, unable to conceive a child, decide to pencil-in their imaginary offspring’s qualities (ex: “He’s a Picasso with a pencil!”) and bury them in a back yard memorial box. Then comes a mysterious storm, a magical child with leaves on his legs, and, eventually, a major problem that will be solved with a homemade pencil. On paper, this kind of quirk would read as heavy-handed in even a Tim Burton or Guy Maddin film, but here it’s all played out with an impressively straight face. Peter Hedge’s direction works hard to shade these fantastical elements with a lot of humanity – or at least the slightly cartoonish Disney version thereof. CJ Adams is impossibly positive, calm and sweet as the titular Timothy Green, but that’s okay. He’s not meant to be as fun or far-reaching as Forrest Gump, yet his curious existence proves to be a lot more meaningful than someone like Benjamin Button’s. We understand that almost explicitly from an early scene at an adoption agency that sets up a character reference interview as the film’s key storytelling device.   The sequence of events derived from your illustrations bring us a lot of simple joys and expected pleasures. And by framing the action mostly at eye level, we can also feel like we’re temporarily a part of the Green family. We feel equally awkward watching Timothy’s penchant for Christ-like poses and embrace the embarrassment of the family’s Little Miss Sunshine concert moment. We might not be blinded by love like an actual family member, but we can accept these moments for what they are. Unfortunately, some of the peripheral plot details remain a bit sketchy; and yes Garner is basically tracing her performance from Juno. The final picture might not be a stoke of genius, but the restraint from making The Odd Life of Timothy Green too colourful goes a long way.

Sure, building a Dream House is inevitably expensive, but how can Universal justify blowing $55 million on this stink hole? Selling out big name actors may raise the audience’s interest rate in the short term, but that’s no way to invest. Everyone loses in the end. I’m going to make it my personal mission to make sure no one else buys into this sub-prime endeavour. There must have been early warning signs that this story was a fraud. First off, I can’t imagine how this was pitched to people signing the cheques. The script begins as a sad exercise in exposition—half-hearted even for a story by the numbers. The set-up is agonizingly slow and also senselessly ambiguous about the genre. I assumed it was a haunted house story, but painful periods of time pass without anything super and/or natural happening. People ask impossibly misinformed and inane questions, which only pay off as we realize that the film is already artistically bankrupt. So maybe the pitch was just “think M. Night Shyamalan,” and then hope studio execs haven’t seen anything since The Sixth Sense. I’m guessing, however, that you cut the crap and sold the dream. There’s only one possible way talent and money were attracted to this mess—the twist. At exactly the mid-way point of the film, everything flips. Dream House goes from painfully dull and formulaic to what I’ll graciously call “a premise with potential”. Or maybe “a handy man’s dream”, as the classifieds trying to sell this off might say. But director Jim Sheridan feels way in over his head, without his oft collaborator Daniel Day Lewis there to bail him out. Here’s the whole blueprint: Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and their two daughters move into a new house only to discover a family (with two daughters) was murdered there five years earlier. Murdered by… Daniel Craig! And the family he murdered was actually… Rachel Weisz and their kids! So now – follow me here – he’s only imagining this happy life we’ve had to watch for half a film. He’s having dreams, in a house! Get it? This is supposed to make up for all the cracks in the film’s foundation until this point. So for the second half, we assume he was too crazy to be locked up, but maybe he was also wrongly convicted. And, let’s not forget, he has a sexy neighbour in Naomi Watts who kind of “understands” him.  That’s a million dollar premise, right? Maybe it could have been. But the bait and switch tactic is, what you might call, insolvent. By this point, so much bad credit has been accumulated by taxing dialogue, inflated pacing and default direction, that the damage is done. We’re ready to just walkway and foreclose. Plus, the film still can’t settle on being a detective story or psychological thriller, so it tries to hide in the margins. I appreciate the resistance to wait for a big last minute reveal, but instead we just want to forget we wasted so much on a hopeless investment. So if you haven’t yet seen the product of all your number-crunching yet, you can now just fast forward to the middle of the film, though this will only spare you half the disappointment. As a professional in these matters, I highly recommend you just cut your losses and declare the whole mess a write off.

As a co-star and producer of the film, the production has unintentionally become your swan song and, in some ways, feels like an appropriate conclusion to your uneven legacy. This film may never reach your signature high notes, but even when it devolves into clichés of drug addictions and abusive husbands, it usually manages to do one thing right – entertain. Despite being a remake of the 1976 film, the title seems designed to shine a light on American idol winner Jordin Sparks, playing Sparkle, but until the third act, the story is equally focused on her oldest sister named… Sister (Carmen Ejogo). This type of on-the-nose naming makes Sparkle feel like it was written by a fourth grader, which might be why it seemed hard for you, playing the girls’ tough-love mother, to scold them with a straight face. Despite your character’s disapproval, they, along with middle sister Dolores, secretly form an all-girl group in 1968 Motown Detroit.  Your stance is supposedly informed by actual experience, since your character once tried to go down the same road. As an audience member, it’s easy for us to believe that background – you’re Whitney Houston!  It does, however, seem highly unlikely for a black woman who would have grown up in 1940s America. But your real-life legacy does some heavy lifting against our potential disbelief. On the other hand, our knowledge of your accomplishments as a performer sets up other heightened expectations for a break–out song that, once it arrives, is underwhelming. Backed by a full gospel choir, and positioned at what should be the right dramatic moment, your song “His Eye is on the Sparrow” lacks emotional thunder and resonance of your best ballads.  The free-styling jazz piano overwhelms the melody and distracts us from feeling the necessary impact of a family falling apart. Not getting enough of what we crave hampers much of the film. Cee Lo Green is the first face we see, playing a rising singer on the scene named Black. Unfortunately, that’s the only time we see him, and although his song “I’m a Man” chugs along with an upbeat pace, it has no connection to the larger story that focuses on women. At least Carmen Ejogo sizzles in her stage performances as Sister and is given some seductive lounge material to work with. But it isn’t until the final stage performance that Sparkle herself gets a chance to shine, at which point it feels like she’s hijacked the finale more than earned her moment in the spotlight. Your face here is flush with pride, and once again the line between character and reality feels blurred as both sides of you seem to itch for a return to glory. Setting the story on the eve of Martin Luther King’s assassination is another missed opportunity, since the political climate is acknowledged, but never embraced. Sparkle herself is constantly encouraged to write more substantial material, but instead she sticks to fluff and only watches experiences around her instead of actually suffering herself. This is one major element in the script you surely could have called out with authority and demanded some authenticity. Instead, the film plays it safe, both in story and song, which makes it enjoyable in the moment, but most likely forgettable. And the last thing any of us want to be is forgettable.

In this post-Toy Story world, where computer animation has become the expected norm, you can forgive one for becoming slightly normalized to the unceasing advances of technology. Every new animated movie seems to come accompanied by new innovations in realism: hair, clothes, even fingerprints. So I was surprised to still marvel at just how tangible everything looked, and felt, in ParaNorman. The story—about a boy who is an outcast in his town for seeing and communicating with the ghosts—may be otherworldly, but everything looks like something you can reach out and grab. Which makes sense – your job as a silicone caster is to actually make the models and puppets used in the stop-motion animation.* The actual physical objects would of course look like, well, actual physical objects and not just a collection of pixels. But the characters in ParaNorman almost pop off the screen. And I’m not referring to the 3D.  I’m convinced it ’s more than physicality that created this illusion. There’s a wonderful sense of what I’d call relaxed anarchy in the characters. Stop-motion animation is a meticulous process that has to be planned down to the fraction of a second. But here, interactions and details, whether it’s a casual game of catch with a dog’s ghost, or something as small as the unhinged jaw of a recently-risen zombie, feel unforced and natural (as much as those can feel natural). All of this effort wouldn’t amount to much without something to drive it, and thankfully ParaNorman also has a strong-enough story and with a great collection of talent to bring it to life. Setting up the plot in the early scenes requires some heavy lifting, but the voice work of Anna Kendrick, Casey Affleck, John Goodman, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (playing, of all things, the school bully), and the lively score by JohnBrion (which includes a few nice nods to past zombie films) help misdirect our attention from the weighty exposition. And once the things get rolling, all that set-up pays off, leading to a quietly touching denouement relying on character rather than noisy incident. It’s a testament to the talent of you and your colleagues that writer-director Chris Butler and director Sam Fell had the faith to let the film’s most important moments play out on the faces of your creations. While the story elements themselves aren’t exactly new—and probably not the easiest to translate to a family film (it does have its share of small-scale chills)—ParaNorman fortunately knows how to mold them into a unique creation. Tangibly yours, Casey Rating: Air Mail (4/5) *Speaking of which, the post-credits time-lapse sequence that shows the amount of work in creating just one of these characters is worth sticking around for. "},{"title":"Synecdoche, New York","url":"/2012/08/21/synecdoche-new-york","date":"2012-08-21 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Karl Sison, Dirt Removal What a job! You had to clean up after the most brazenly defiled movies in recent memory. There are no unsoiled nooks or crannies, no moments of clarity, and certainly no tidy resolutions to be found. This isn’t an artsy film you can just watch for clean-cut profanity or nudity (though there is some). This is a grimy, heart-wrenchingly authentic and baroque mess. This is a movie that muddies the divide between American and “foreign” films. This is a project that’s touching, dangerous, tentatively rewarding, and drenched in self-indulgence. Your task to keep things pristine was therefore impossible, which somehow feels perfect. I admit I didn’t see it coming. I have enjoyed Charlie Kaufmann’s scripts, and remember my initial consternation about the fact that he directed this new film himself. The story follows the saddest man alive (Philip Seymour Hoffman, reprising his roles), a theatre director whose sudden windfall sends him on a journey towards true and complete artistic honesty. Helping him dig into the depths of his soul are companions and foils played wonderfully by Catherine Keener, Michelle Williams, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Samantha Morton, Tom Noonan, and more. What could have been a sterile revenge story becomes hopelessly complex when confronted with the dirty reality of artistic endeavors and acts of the will. Did you think Unforgiven was honest? Was Atonement about how it really feels to regret something? Only if you remove all the fertile, tactile, real dirt of everyday life. Despite the focus on authenticity, this is not a movie of tiny truths. Reality itself is turned on its head. The passage of time, the limits of ambition, the realities of the human body are dealt with head-on. It also reminds me that Synecdoche, New York came out in 2008—the same year as The Dark Knight. If the narrative post-mortem is that the Joker role was simply too much for Heath Ledger, then there should be no possible way that Philip Seymour Hoffman is still alive. He may always play the sad sack, but it’s too easy to forget how compelling, vulnerable, and continually believable he is. The way he truly gets under the skin of dark characters is almost unhygienic. I may be late to the party, but this movie offers a timeless and open invite. If it seems I’m being vague, it’s not on purpose. You can’t explain this movie. Although it may not be of quite the same caliber, it belongs in the same conversation as Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. This could only exist as film. And that in itself is an achievement. The real dirty trick is that all the people that do see the movie will think it’s about themselves.

You have a star-studded cast of machine guns, rifles, pistols, and hand weapons, wielded by their equally-famous action hero counterparts, and there is no discipline, no control. Everything you, the person responsible for arming these muscleheads, should stand against. As a fan of guns and action, even I know “spray and pray” is the wrong approach in almost every situation. You just make a huge mess and accomplish nothing. In that first sequence your .50 caliber heavy machine guns and rocket launchers make the bad guys practically explode. That’s probably pretty accurate. But then the assault rifles join in, and they make guys explode. Then the submachine guns do. Then the pistols. Even punches. To the untrained eye, these sleek embodiments of testosterone may all seem similar. But as connoisseurs, we know each has unique characteristics and ideal theatres of combat that make them truly shine. Too bad this movie just treats these icons, both machine and man, all exactly the same. Take, for example, one of the stars, the Noveske Rifleworks Diplomat with M68 Aimpoint red dot scope and Surefire M900 weapon-light fore-grip (used by Jet Li and Sylvester Stallone). This is a very compact, precise, and reliable weapon. Built for moving fast in tight corners, it gets quickly discarded for a frying pan in close combat, and later its shooter just stands in the open, spraying away at armored targets hundreds of feet away. Did you ever step in and say “Hey, you are doing it wrong”? Then there are great big guns like the AA-12 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Benelli M4 Super 90 (Terry Crewes). Firing them non-stop at distant henchmen in body armor is pointless.  Then there are modern classics like the HK416 (Bruce Willis), G36C  (Chuck Norris), M4A1 (Randy Couture), and UMP45 (Dolph Lundgren) that just sort of wander around, shooting off indiscriminately and without joy. The plot itself is set in motion by a stupid misuse of the Barrett M107 sniper rifle (played by Liam Helmsworth), which is sent up alone, without a spotter, in unknown terrain. This inevitably goes badly, and the fire team has to seek revenge to alleviate what must be guilt for such terrible tactics. It turns out to be part of a larger plot to turn five tons of secret Russian plutonium into the most abused weapon of them all. To your credit, there are some better, more intimate moments, performed by knives, brass knuckles, and fists. Those are pretty special, with notorious human weapons like Jet Li and Unstoppable II’s Scott Adkins bringing the film’s best fights. The most suprising scenes involve even more exotic weapons, like a jump-knife-kick to the heart (Jean-Claude Van Damme)  or a sturdy thurbile (Jason Statham).  There are even some emotions (mostly Nan Yu), which seem to disarm the human characters almost immediately. Still, as soon as the bullets start flying in earnest, it’s back to Heckler & Koch for most everyone. You do give a great summary of the conceit of The Expendables 2 in your choice of handguns: making a desperate case for old-fashioned tools that have already had their day. I’m referring, of course, to the Custom Kimber Gold Combat IIs and that short-barreled Colt Single Action Army (played by Sylvester Stallone). You have to force their continued relevance amidst today’s firepower with implausible success. You simply can’t kill a man at 50 yards, shot from the hip, while running, with one of these things. Lying about it will alienate anyone who cares. It would have been so much more interesting if the realities of the weapons and the actors were given more than a quick and dismissive nod. But the people who make the movie make the rules, and they clearly have a different idea of fun. A lot of people won’t like this movie because it’s murderous, loud, poorly written, and a little bit boring. But being a weapons guy, I wonder whether this really loaded your chamber, either. The more you know about all these amazing guns, held by all these fun actors, the more it seems the movie turns against for its own selfish goals of pretending to be relevant.

Then I could congratulate you for adding to the chorus of female empowerment spoken and sung through this intelligently absorbing film. Instead, I’m singling you out as the man who’s job it is to silence their voices. How dare you! I wanted more! I loved everything this film had to say, and more importantly, how they said it. I suppose most of the credit belongs to Lebanese director/producer/co-writer/star Nadine Labaki. Her film, set in an unspecified Middle Eastern village, follows an isolated community of Muslims and Christians who are cut off from the religious conflicts that surround them. But as sectarian mischief and violence draws near, the women of both faiths band together and find increasingly creative ways to make their men see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. The result is the most serious comedy I’ve ever seen. Having an important message actually helps the humour at every turn. When the entire village is together watching their only TV, the way you edit in the women’s desperate outbursts to drown out the news is expertly done.  We’re trying to hear both sides – the women’s overblown accusations of men picking their nose, as well as the newscaster explaining a recent conflict. What we can make out provides just the right balance of tension and comedic release. The opening scene also hits that equilibrium perfectly. The women, dressed in black, seem to be performing a silent flash mob dance on their way to a funeral.  Their faces are cold and serious, but their movements are warm, tightly choreographed and too complicated to be strictly traditional. This juxtaposition perfectly sets our expectations for the type of hybrid film we’re about to see. No wonder Canucks made it the surprise Audience Award winner at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. In relation to Canadian cinema, it’s like La grande seduction meets Incendies. With a touch Bollywood. Your job certainly got easier when the women bring a bus full of blonde Russian female dancers to the village as temporary distractions: the men are left speechless watching the bathing beauties. But a misinterpretation also reveals an unexpected rift in the story’s central romance. The way Labaki’s character translates and exchange from Arabic to English reveals exactly how much misogyny and violence the women are willing to hide to protect their men. Seeing this example of diagetic dialogue editing helps us appreciate how nuanced your job can be behind the scenes. Let me end by saying the film works wonders. The stakes are sky high and the final resolution is bold, unexpected, and poignant. You clearly understood what to emphasize, and eventually let actions speak louder than words. I guess you knew what you were doing after all. So you get the last laugh – literally, since the title comes from a climactic moment of clearly articulated dialogue.

Cyclists, that’s who. We who ride recumbent constantly fear illegally pulled-over obstacles and swinging door booby traps that clog the arteries of a city. It’s about time someone found a way to translate the speed and hazards of the road into a full-tilt action feature. It’s also one of the most exciting and kinetic action films of the year. I just hope you were paying attention. On one hand, you and the real-life superhero—literally a man in tights—of Premium Rush seem like the yin and yang of transportation. Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is named after the Coyote, but he’s more like the Road Runner. As a fixed gear, steel frame, no brakes bicycle courier, he squeezes through the seams of the city and lives for a new rush every hour. By contrast, you block off huge sections of the street for a fleet of equipment trucks, craft cars and actor’s trailers. Less sexy, sure, but at least it’s safe. When Wilee unknowingly picks up a package worth a lot of money to the Chinese mafia, he’s suddenly trying to outride good cops, bad cops, fellow couriers, and worst of all – New York City itself. Basically the same big honking mess you had to deal with every day. In fact, you two have more in common than you might think. Figuring out where to put your vehicle becomes one of the most inventive conceits of co-writer and director David Koepp’s storytelling. “Wilee vision”, as I’ll call it, slows down reality and simulates the potential outcomes of various paths. Beyond being a fun way to add violence to a film with a relatively low body count, the visual trick helps the audience understand the risks of the road. That might double as a kick-ass public service announcement, but the primary purpose is to keep your pulse pounding. And it works. Despite all the Google-map angles and chronology mashing, Premium Rush operates on a grounded, visceral level that feels authentic. Peddling and having to earn your speed is only part of it. Unlike the Crank films that take a lot of their energy from hand-held camera work, the steady and smooth cinematography as we fly down the streets makes me think you had much more than a small guerilla crew to maneuver. Yet the story is always on the move, so I’m guessing those cars you parked didn’t stick around for long. More work for you, but it’s a lot more fun for us. That said, I trust after working on this film that you realize the implications of your job. Putting a car in the wrong place at the wrong time can be deadly.

For you, I’m guessing it’s an ability to reflect the director’s vision with your relentless commitment to accurate design details. You certainly accomplished what you set out to do, giving us the dusty taverns and dilapidated farmsteads we’ve come to expect from a picture that takes place during the Depression. I’m just amazed director John Hillcoat wasn’t able to capture the essence of your hard work in a more unique way.  The tale of the bootlegging Bondurant brothers was first told by their grandson Matt Bondurant in his novel The Wettest County in the World. The pressure to hold up certain truths of this “real-life” story may have subsequently weighed the filmmakers down. I don’t know how faithful the adaptation is to the book, but the overall treatment seems to follow, with almost mathematical precision, the blueprint of standard American gangster films. The only problem, I think you’ll agree, is that filmmakers shouldn’t approach their craft the same way as you carpenters. At least the foundation is strong—we have the gun-shy youngest brother, played by Shia LeBoeuf, trying to earn the respect of his brawn-over-brains older brothers. So he makes a deal with the devil (Gary Oldman as a brazen Chicago gangster), which allows the family moonshine business to boom—temporarily, of course. At the height of their power, we see your finest work: the elaborately-constructed distillery deep in the Virginia backwoods. This location provides our most unique moment of insight into their world, before the dreams they’ve built on the back of an unpopular and violently enforced law inevitably come crashing down.  For a film premiering at Cannes, I think it was reasonable to expect the director of The Proposition and The Road, in tackling this dark chapter in American history, to create a uniquely bleak picture. Instead, we get a passable and familiar portrait of prohibition outlaws who, unfortunately, are far less interesting than those already perfected on HBO’s Boardwalk Empire. Even Guy Pearce, who undertakes an inspired physical transformation to create a dementedly eccentric law officer, feels like he’s performing in the shadow of Michael Shannon’s Nelson Van Alden. French audiences on La Croisette must have also had a case of déjà vu after the similarly themed (and titled) Outside the Law premiered at the same festival two years ago, and was also about three gangster brothers rising to folk-hero status. The world you built around these characters certainly feels authentic, but the story and execution feels all too common. Hillcoat and company have proven that they have the tools at their disposal to create something bold and memorable, but instead we get the architectural equivalent of a suburban home: sturdy, dependable, but, ultimately, uninspired.  Hope you’re building a better future, Christopher Status: Standard Delivery (3/5) "},{"title":"Robot & Frank","url":"/2012/08/31/robot-frank","date":"2012-08-31 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Will Sheck, Greensman, Are you surprised? Writing to the person responsible for any kind vegetation used on a movie set, might seem an odd choice for a movie like Robot & Frank, which is set in the  “near future,” (as the film describes it). It’s usually other crew members, like the futurists, concept designers, or effects people who take on responsibility for realizing a fantasy world. Thankfully, this future vision is made up of small distinctions from our present time. Mostly things are smaller (cars that are half the size of current Smart cars, cellphones are made of a single pane of glass, even micro-loans have evolved to nano-loans). Your work, though, and the care that it requires, represents the best of this little movie, which thrives despite some weedy patches. Frank, played by the reliably strong Frank Langella, is a man growing old by himself who has begun suffering memory loss, which makes it difficult for him to do the one thing he loves the most: break into people’s homes and steal. He’s a mostly-retired (they’re never really retire, do they?) cat burglar. Living by himself in a house on the outskirts of an unnamed town, Frank spends his days walking into town, flirting with the librarian (Susan Sarandon), and engaging in some minor shoplifting. The memory loss, however, is becoming more pronounced—to the point that one of his grown sons, Hunter (James Marsden), decides that Frank needs a helper to not only take physical care of Frank and his house, but to also establish a routine and diet that will at least slow the memory loss. Enter Robot. One of Robot’s main activities for Frank falls squarely into your artistic domain: gardening. It (Robot has a male voice provided by Peter Saarsgard, but is always referred to as an ‘it’) digs up a patch in the lawn, and plants some garden vegetables: tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. And as this garden flourishes—even with Frank’s indifference to Robot and its urge to contribute—Frank’s mental state begins to improve. Now this isn’t tied to the garden directly, as Robot also has Frank eating better (steamed vegetables equal more greenery), and doing more physical activity; but the continued shots of Robot watering and tending to the garden, as well as the growth of the plants themselves, line up with Frank’s return to a version of his old self. Robot’s gardening routine does grow on Frank over time. As you must very well know, gardening is often used as a metaphor for renewal, and here it does some of that work.* Robot’s diligence, along with the budding plats, eventually inspire Frank to do something more: return to stealing. In Robot, Frank has found the perfect partner: emotionally uninvolved, but proficient at a level no human could ever achieve. The central, and best, parts of the film detail Frank and Robot planning some new heists - just the type of project, Frank argues, that keeps an old mind sharp. The deadpan, flat readings of Saarsgard play against Langella’s gruff but vulnerable Frank. *Although this is not a tied-directly-to-the-plot-to-the-point-of-telling-the-story use of that metaphor like it was in E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, successful as it was in that film. If only everything in the film was tended to with as much care as well as this central relationship. Liv Tyler’s Madison, Frank’s daughter, speaks of the inequality created by treating robots as slaves, but this idea seems trimmed before it has time to bear any fruit. Major characters played by Jeremy Strong and Jeremy Sisto are only partly realized, relying on the actors to grow something in the infertile soil of Christopher D. Ford’s script. (Sisto is more successful, adding some comic line readings that make his Sherriff more of a rounded human than he must have appeared on paper; Strong’s creation comes off as and effete mashup of Tim Burton and Atom Egoyan.) And some late film character revelations feel false when compared with earlier actions. But, like the circular shape of the garden you helped create for the files, Robot & Frank does return back to its strengths just enough to make it work overall.  And your lovely garden manages to play a central role in the closing moments. Does all of this add up to a profound, circle of life-type statement? In a word, no. But that’s okay. Robot & Frank’s goals aren’t that high. It’s content to do just enough work to let one flower bloom, even if other buds have to be discarded along the way.

You’re learning the essential task of tracking down the street, space, or building that is a physical expression of the subtext of a scene or sequence. For much of The Possession, that location is a newly-built home in a suburban development still under construction. Unfortunately for this Sam Raimi-produced horror flick, as with most cookie-cutter McMansions, a pretty facade conceals structural malfeasance. In The Possession, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is the delinquent divorced dad who, apparently hoping to conjure a bit of that 1950s-nuclear-family-vibe, buys the aforementioned house. On weekends, he entertains his two daughters, easily distinguishable as The Bookish One and The Popular One (the latter played by Madison Davenport, who bears a rather distracting resemblance to pre-pubescent Lindsay Lohan). And though the house has nothing directly to do with ensuing supernatural horror—no, the MacGuffin here is a polished wooden box covered in strange Hebrew markings that Bookish Daughter buys at a garage sale – it is the scene of much pseudo-religious foolery: voices whispering in dead languages, distorted faces in mirrors, an invasion of perpetually agitated moths, heavy piano notes. The house’s remoteness is sort of enthralling – we never see anyone else in the neighborhood, we never see the lights in the other half-built homes – but that sense of isolation, of being cut off from the rest of the world, is never explored. Sadly, director Ole Bornedal is concerned only with building something that appears, from afar, to be a suspense film. Once you get inside, nothing holds up to inspection. The foundation is cracked: there’s no logic to the way the story jumps from one scene to another, or to the way characters react to the strange transformation of a precocious Harriet-the Spy-type into the kind of stringy-haired girl-creature who climbs out of televisions in Japanese horror movies. Protective mom Kyra Sedgwick in particular, will probably require surgical reconstruction after this much nervous lip-biting. Atrocious dialogue is strung like faulty wiring throughout each scene. When Morgan proclaims, “There’s something more going on here!” it’s the spoken equivalent of knob and tube. Even an amateur will recognize that something is afoul with this  blatantly obsolete expression of an essential component. There’s something wrong with the furnace, too: the temperature goes from swarthy-hot to church-vestibule-cold from scene to scene. Right after a jokey tête-a-tête with a university professor (where we finally get a sense of Raimi’s influence), Morgan goes full-Philip-Seymour-Hoffman while tearfully begging a group of Hasidic holy men to help him exorcise the demon who has taken possession of his daughter. It’s enough to make you sick. You’re at the beginning of your career, Ryan, and it’s just as important for you to learn what not to do. In this case, don’t go cheap. You can’t cut any corners. Even when time is short and materials are scarce. A well-built film is the sum of its smallest parts. Unfortunately, even for a late-summer Exorcist-wannabe, The Possession isn’t up to code. Next time you’re looking for that exact right location, remember that craftsmanship matters: the architectural plans, the landscaping, the paint swatches for the sunroom—none of it means anything if you’re not going to take pride in every strut, every nail, every frame.

I laughed, but a professional gear-head like you probably felt like showing her what a hit and run really looks like. But don’t worry, that singular zinger for us non-car aficionados wasn’t enough to endear us to this Fast and Furious-lite. It’s still a car movie—even if has less excitement than your average Nissan commercial. The real wheelman of this film, of course, is writer/co-director/editor/star/ex-Punk’d-performer Dax Shepard. As the engineer of his own star-making vehicle, he plays a man living in witness protection after a bank job gone wrong. Life in his sleepy town gets complicated when his new girlfriend wants to move back to Los Angeles, the scene of the crime,. He volunteers to drive her cross-country to an all-important job interview, all the while being pursued by his tipped-off and ticked-off former crew. And the entire time cars control the comedy, the action, the drama, and, of course, the resolution. Tom Arnold, playing a U.S. Marshal assigned to protect Shepard, gets the vehicular antics going when he idiotically leaves his mini-van in gear. He shoots at the windows to try and stop it, but, before the van can take out a young family, a hedge and stone fence does the job for him. More than a moment of comedy, Shepard is using your first stunt to establish the light-hearted stakes and controlled chaos that run throughout the rest of the film. When Bradley Cooper and his two completely underused sidekicks finally join the pursuit, the first showdown takes place in an abandoned airfield. Donuts are spun, tires are screeched, but the whole thing feels like test footage in a safe environment that should have included one of those “closed course” disclaimers from television ads. Moments like this can’t help but call attention to the budget, even if, from your end, it probably felt like a big flat playground for you to enjoy. The final leg of the race includes a cool looking Baja buggy, but the most memorable beat is when it gracefully rides up the stairs of a university and comes to a nice stop. Sure, it has to take the obligatory detour down that perpetually dry L.A. River culvert (a Hollywood stunt driver favourtie location) but it only feels like a sightseeing trip of more exciting car chases from Point Blank, The Italian Job, Gone in 60 Seconds, To Live and Die in L.A. and of course Grease. It’s fast company you’re trying to keep, but this film is a little slow on the pick-up. The filmmakers do manage to get a second funny rape joke in the film, however. Wait…is there a reason those were the only jokes I laughed at? I guess Kristen Bell was right: I really dug that souped-up car.

I think it’s safe to say you’ve contributed amply to Mr. Quaid’s success; for him to be more than just a pretty face something needed to democratize his steely good-looks, and the earthy resonance you produce – both gritty and articulate, like rusty guitar strings strummed by a virtuoso – has been as vital to his charm as that squint, that grin, that loping stride. In The Words, Mr. Quaid plays novelist Clay Hammond—but it’s you, his twin layrngal mucous membranes, who really take center stage, modulating the air expelled by his lungs to form the words that narrate the film. The conceit is this: Hammond is reading a passage from his latest book in front of an adoring crowd, and the story-within-a-story follows an aspiring writer (Bradley Cooper), who, after much rejection and repudiation, discovers his salvation in a Parisian junk shop: a forgotten novel manuscript that he passes off as his own. It’s immediately evident, from the very first line you’re asked to deliver – which is supposed to be the opening line of a critically-acclaimed novel, but instead sounds like something poached from a teenage girl’s poetry journal – that this film doesn’t take place in the real world. The Words is all conspicuous plot movement, convenient character beats, and simple sentiment—the life of a novelist as seen through the dramatic lens of As The World Turns. I’m not saying it’s your fault, guys. To be honest, you sounded a bit strained. Stretched to your physiological limits. Unnaturally vacillated. Indeed, the way the Mr. Quaid uses you, projecting a deadpan reading voice that enunciates each word as an individual phoneme, putting emphasis and accents in the strangest places, makes his voice-over feel somehow eloquent and empty at the same time. The whole film strains awkwardly for profundity in the same way. We get the fantastical writing-the-book scene, as the committed novelist hammers at his keyboard, pauses to think, nods, and continues to hammer (am I the only one who, in the act of writing, only touches the keyboard about ten-percent of the time?). We get a scene of a drunk stumbling down a cobblestone street, humming to himself, tipping a half-empty bottle down his throat with all the subtlety of an Abbott & Costello routine. And Cooper is doe-eyed throughout, making earnest pronouncements about chasing his dreams, giving precociously humble speeches at awards ceremonies. All the swagger with which he coasted so comfortably through films like The Hangover and Limitless is gone; here he’s the leading-man equivalent of one of those motivational posters with a mountaineer silhouetted against the sunset. Mr. Quaid’s struggles to keep you in tune wouldn’t stand out so much if it weren’t for the fact that you’re not the only pair of vocal cords driving the narrative forward. In the story-within-a-story-within-a-story that makes up much of the second half of the film, Jeremy Irons brings his accomplished oscillating folds onto the soundtrack. He’s one of the all-time masters, and I’ll be honest, friends, his adductions and abductions put you to shame.  While it might not be your finest performance, you’ve certainly earned your paycheck (how exactly does Mr. Quaid divide his profits between you and his chin-dimple and that lock of hair that always falls perfectly over his right eye?). Take a break, relax, enjoy a cup of hot Earl Grey with a bit of honey and lemon. There wasn’t much you could do. Your rough phonation is too real, too scabrous and sincere, for a film that is interested only in histrionic notions of art.  Sincerely, Jared Young Rating: Return to sender (2/5)"},{"title":"TIFF: Cloud Atlas","url":"/2012/09/10/cloud-atlas","date":"2012-09-10 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":"Dear Glynn Henderson, Safety Consultant I’m so glad nobody listened to you. Cloud Atlas is unbelievably ambitious, unusually paced and virtually indescribable. The story gleefully spans centuries but snubs chronology, relentlessly repurposes actors, mixes genres and genders, and seems to basically disregard everything we’ve seen before about how to make an epic. Hollywood filmmaking until this point might one day be referred to as B.C.A. (Before Cloud Atlas).  Whatever advice you provided for playing it safe clearly fell on deaf ears. This might be the most dangerous film ever made. The challenges you faced seem endless. The earliest story in the film occurs about 200 years ago, with additional tales taking place throughout the 20th century and into unspecified futures. Characters are put in a smorgasbord of dangers all over the world, from climbing mountains to crossing futuristic skyways, and all the risks look tangibly possible.  We might not always follow everything, but we can certainly feel it. The stunt coordinators, at least, heeded your advice and staged much of the climactic action in the secure confines of a studio. The producers, however, defied the studio system altogether for the financing. Their only precaution against creating a big budget flop was to cast Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Susan Sarandon and some up-and-coming international talent. But as Battlefield Earth taught us, stars alone won’t guarantee success. So even though giving these types of warnings may have been outside your job description, your responsibility should actually have been to embody all facets of safety. This is, after all, a film where everyone plays many roles in an attempt to uncover their eternal character and true purpose. But what is the purpose of this film? In a word: revolution. And revolution, by its very nature, cannot be safe. All the characters in this story are rising up against the systems that control them. That same spirit to confidently defy conventions is embraced by the filmmaking approach, and reflects the philosophy of the filmmakers themselves (with Lana Wachowski, for example, going public about her transforming from Larry). Thematically, that rebellious through-line carries over nicely from the The Matrix films, even if this story is based on David Mitchell’s novel. In Cloud Atlas, the connection is clearest in the Neo Korea storyline, but can certainly be found throughout – on a slave-stowing ship crossing the Pacific, in the homosexual trysts of a pre-WW2 musical virtuoso, in a bold journalist digging up dirt in the 70s, in a kooky book publisher trying to plead for his sanity, and in a robotic Geisha finding her humanity.  It just seems to be in everyone’s DNA to disregard any advice about doing something simply for their own well-being. Aside from the writers, directors and producers, the make-up team may be the most brazen department to work without a net. There was a time when doing black-face was considered racist, but I guess that was way back in the year 1 B.C.A (2011 AD). Now, in the Wachowski and Tykwer “post-racial” world, whites can play Asians, Asians can play whites, and Halle Berry can tease us with Jewish nudity. For at least half the film, it’s often as distracting as it sounds, even when the story is not mixing races. Tom Hanks alone performs a career’s worth of characters, from the unintelligible to the hilarious. Yet by the end, there’s obviously some sense to be made of it all. That said, I couldn’t spoil the plot if I tried. The unmistakable tonal shifts between the film’s three directors risks turning the whole experiment into a series of sideshows, but instead sets us up for some unpredictable turns. The audience at the world premiere screening in Toronto went from cheering on a charming triumph to absolute shock from the brutality of the next scene. The contrasts certainly earn the film an R-rating, using language, violence and nudity that can kill a blockbuster. But when a film is already bound to be so divisive, challenging and hard to promote, why not go all the way? Well, congratulations. Against all advice, you went there. To a place we didn’t even know existed. Without standard plotting or pacing, we get a film we often can’t follow, and yet, cannot turn away. What survives is truly a triumph of the medium. At one point, a character is told “one may transcend any convention if only one can dream of doing so.” Indeed Dangerously yours, Christopher"},{"title":"TIFF: Argo","url":"/2012/09/12/argo","date":"2012-09-12 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Max Daly, Researcher, Hollywood has a habit of recklessly re-writing history to sell a story. It’s entertainment, so no one’s complaining—well, except for researchers like you. In your line of work, fudging the facts might be disastrous. But for Tony Mendez and the six American diplomats trying to sneak out of Iran during the revolution of 1979, getting a detail wrong would have been deadly. We feel those consequences to maximum effect in Argo, a masterfully suspenseful dramatization of the now-declassified rescue mission, reconstructed with incredible period detail by you and director Ben Affleck. The vintage Warner Brother’s logo fades into a condensed history of Iran, helping us non-history-buffs catch up on the sociopolitical mood of Iran in the late 70s. The technique works beautifully, employing illustrated storyboards, that pre-production staple, to foreshadow the upcoming film-centric story. Six Americans have escaped the overrun U.S. embassy, taking refuge at the Canadian Ambassador’s home with no way out until CIA operative Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) cooks up a plan for them to pose as a Canadian film crew. The stakes are sky-high, not just for the individuals involved, but for two countries teetering on the edge of war. To make this cover story believable, Mendez does you proud by doing his research. He flies to L.A. to start up a production office and recruits the help of some Hollywood handy men played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin, who offer wonderful moments of comedic reprieve. As a director, Affleck strikes a perfect balance, never undermining the importance of the trip by getting too silly, and drawing the audience in with compelling inter-character drama. When things ramp up, we see the Iranians literally piecing together clues, even using child labor to assemble shredded documents. It’s an archeological-level excavation that needs to be completed in days, not years, and would probably put most academics to shame. Research by both factions is ratcheted up to a breakingpoint until it skillfully unravels. The tension is made more powerful for those us unfamiliar with the real-life details by your commitment to putting them onscreen. Of course, even if we know the broad strokes (Affleck had no problem spelling those out at the TIFF premiere), it’s a credit to everyone involved that the overall drama is always credible. Of course, retelling history with emotional textures requires a certain flair that research alone cannot provide. Just like the characters themselves, you need imagination and informed invention to fill in the gaps. But unlike the Iranian Imperial Guard, I have no interest in checking your sources. I did, however, appreciate the final credit sequence that offers a side-by-side comparisons of actors with the real-life people they portrayed and shows the perfect replicas created by the production design team. Ultimately, I bought everything. You did your research well enough to convince me that you deserve to pass the checkpoint.

However, it’s possible he told you that showing an actor how to convincingly play the piano is a lot like directing someone how to fall in love on screen. You can go through the motions – staring down passionately at busy hands or swaying side-to-side in imagined euphoria – and then depend on carefully placed music and clever editing to create meaning. But the Kuleshov effect can only go so far; there’s no substitute for a single well-placed medium shot that exposes a performer’s true abilities. And piano or not, no director knows the power of a motionless, soul-exposing camera better than Michael Haneke. Knowing and forgetting how to tickle the ivory is, however, of central importance to Amour. Two piano teachers, named George and Anne, like all Haneke duos, are in their twilight years when Anne has an unspecified medical emergency. Played with draining authenticity by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuel Riva, the two try to come to terms with Anne’s medical condition, which emotionally transposes her into someone that George no longer recognizes. This classification may sound a lot like Sarah Polley’s Away From Her, but the two tales are certainly played in drastically different keys. However, Amour arguably relies upon the audience’s familiarity with Haneke’s directorial tendencies to truly appreciate this film’s tension. As an auteur, he excels at playing every emotional note in a deceptive cadence before suddenly pounding out a beat of violence. These forte moments do occur in Amour, but their impact would certainly be less cathartic for to the untrained eye.  In the same way your own job changes completely if an actor has no background in music, hooking an unfamiliar audience on the subtexts of Amour is a much bigger challenge Still, the story is a very accessible drama, and the auteurish flourishes elevate the material. Long, steady wide shots, like that of an audience arriving at a piano recital are void of explicit meaning, and will either draw in cinematic connoisseurs rigorously scanning the screen for clues ,while leaving others impatiently wondering when the film will return to it’s rhythm. It eventually does, even if Haneke has no interest in finding a hook that will become the next big hit. And even so, the emotions certainly strike the right chord.

But there is one key similarity – the video assist. This modern piece of technology helps both athletes and actors assess their own performance, and the strategies of their counterparts, instantaneously.  It also has the power to nearly end a wildly hot-tempered director’s career when leaked online, as I’m sure your boss would like to forget. However, even if nothing viral-worthy happened on-set this time around, the final film is full of performances I’m envious you got to watch over and over again. Silver Linings Playbook, director David O. Russell’s exploration of rehabilitation, is at first a showcase for Bradley Cooper, playing Pat Solitano in the role of his career. Pat’s a bipolar ex-teacher trying to make a comeback after an eight-month stint in a mental institution. He always speaks first and thinks later, while obsessessing over a single play he thinks will win him back his ex-wife. The tunnel vision distracts him from Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a formerly promiscuous pill-popper overcoming a tragedy herself and looking for a way to recover. Tiffany’s tactic is to go on the offensive, making rather explicit advances and appeals to Pat. Her approach feels like it’s being looped on playback, as she constantly follows his jogging route to manufacture some not-so-subtle run-ins. These moments embrace some of the strongest dynamics of the film – a push and pull relationship that is expertly staged but somehow feels convincingly natural. Even Chris Tucker, who basically is only around for a re-occurring gag throughout the film, gives an impressively restrained performance without ever sacrificing a laugh. Best of all, Robert DeNiro, as a superstitious football fanatic father, turns in his most well-rounded performance in years. He strikes a skilled balance of concern and care, before his own gambling addiction adds another layer to the drama. I imagine that watching the rushes of his performance, and the whole ensemble cast, helped you immediately realize you were working with a winner. Beyond well-oiled comedy and believable idiosyncrasies, the film eventually packs an even bigger emotional punch than The Fighter. I was caught off guard by such well-earned misty moment, even if on paper if seems like the oldest play in the book. But swelling music or manipulative edits are nowhere to be found. I probably would have been just as affected by watching the raw footage. So unlike you, I’ll never know if there were only subtle differences between takes or dramatically different interpretations attempted by the actors. But what made the final cut certainly belongs in the big leagues.

The Seven Psychopaths in Martin McDonagh’s new film look like soldiers of the Salvation Army marching on the Republic of Ralph Lauren. No doubt that you ran frantically between second-hand stores and high-end retailers trying to find all the right outfits to layer this disarmingly charming black comedy. Well, I’m happy to report that your choice of distinctly American apparel provided a refreshing redressing of this down-on-their-luck gang of deadbeats. The trend of overly-articulate, pop-culture-spewing gangsters has been à la mode in Hollywood for the past two decades. That’s one of the reasons McDonagh succeeds—the premise is painfully self-aware, even though the characters aren’t. Colin Farrell is a Gap-wearing writer looking for inspiration to dress up a screenplay that has little going for it but a catchy title: \"Seven Psychopaths. His loyal friend, played by Sam Rockwell, is trying to help, but his manic suggestions reveal that he isn’t quite as cool as his burgundy leather jacket suggests. Woody Harrelson, playing a gangster in broad collars seemingly tailored circa 1978, has his Shih Tzu stolen by Rockwell and in his quest to retrieve the pooch, wreaks vengeance on anyone who stands in his way. But the best-dressed award – and most memorable performance – belongs to Christopher Walken, whose classy cravat conceals his dog-stealing day job and cutthroat commitments.  In the secondary roles, costumes and characters get even louder: from an ex-Vietcong soldier who masquerades as a priest to an Amish farmer hell-bent on revenge. There are also a few scantily clad women lounging about, but their relevance to the story is just passing fad. This film is firmly in the men’s section, bearing guns and glory as a signature piece, but unafraid, at times, to reveal its delicate underthings. When the collection of psychos is finally revealed, it’s a nice to see the film hasn’t traded style for substance. Caring about psychopaths isn’t easy. But in this case, it’s all the rage.

Mohanan, Cinematographer, For the first 30 minutes, you had me eating out of the palm of your hand. The seedy underbelly of Bombay’s film industry in 1986, where porn films are secretly shot and smuggled into select cinemas, has all the grime and gritty texture you could ask for in a mystery. The film initially feels like Boogie Nights Bollywood, but not just for the subject matter. Your cinematography is truly in the same league as Robert Elswit –capturing all the right details and reflecting a cold distance between the characters, while looking especially authentic in the films-within-a-film. And then something strange happens – the titular Miss Lovely enters the story and somehow ruins everything. To be clear, this has nothing to do with the way you shot lead actress Niharika Singh, nor is it a criticism of her abilities as an actress. But her entire character feels like a secondary distraction from the crimes and murder that compel us early on. The screenplay half-heartedly sets up the story as if it will be her descent into this dangerous lifestyle, but director Ashim Ahluwalia feels strangely uninterested in aggressively pursuing this story or one involving a murder early in the film, much like his surrogate director within the film, played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The narrative becomes unfocused and often meanders with an artistic sensibility that seems opposed to generating any emotion. By the time secrets are revealed, they lack any punch and unintentionally add to the confusion. Too bad, because this film was looking so good.

You belong to the group of technicians that take films shot in 2D—a format that has served cinematic storytelling just fine, thank you very much, for over 100 years—and turn them into dim, muddled visual messes that are at best passable, and at worst, atrocities.1 So colour me shocked that I found myself appreciating not just the movie, but your  work specifically in Dredd (AKA Dredd 3D,for the more easily confused filmgoers, I guess). And I don’t mean I enjoyed it in a “when I say the 3D was good that means I didn’t really notice it” way, either. It very much enhanced the film in the way it was (I assume) meant to be enhanced. You’ll get no harsh judgments from me here. Granted, there may have never been a plot conceit so suited to the merits of 3D as the narcotic that is the catalyst of much of Dredd’s mayhem. “Slo-mo” as it’s called, is said to slow the perception of time down to “1 percent of normal” (because in the future, this is apparently measureable), heightening the user’s surroundings. The 3D really shines here, effectively putting us inside the heads of an addict. During these sequences, it feels like we can focus on every detail at an almost a molecular level. With all that effort lavished on just the drug sequences, the filmmakers must have paid as much attention on the plot, right? Well, no. The basic premise of  Dredd is about two parts Robocop, a half part Die Hard, one part Blade Runner, and five  parts The Raid: Redemption.2 Badass supercop (Karl Urban as the titular Judge Dredd) in a futuristic mega city (named, aptly enough, Mega City One) descends on a complex controlled by a drug lord (Lena Heady) and must make his way to the top to dispense, well, judgement. Accompanying him is a hopeful-Judge-in-training(Olivia Thirlby), who Dredd helpfully refers to as “Rookie” (so add maybe another 1 part The Rookie into that plot formula). But like my appreciation of your 3D work—something I’m usually adverse to—I appreciated this stripped down formula. Dredd introduces its scenario efficiently, and gets right to the action with no apologies.   Now if we’re going to talk about a well executed movie and your 3D contributions, it only seems natural to discuss the three dimensional characters as well, doesn’t it? Sure it does, except there aren’t any here. And again, against the odds, this didn’t bother me. Even in John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra’s original comic, Judge Dredd was the very definition of caricature; in fact that was his point. And it’s a credit to screenwriter Alex Garland and director Pete Travis that they don’t feel the need to add conventional motivations and back story to Dredd (Thirlby’s Anderson gets the token amount). I may have just been happy that Rob Schneider didn’t show up to ruin the movie, but I don’t think so. Overall, they work like Dredd – decisive action says everything you need And in today’s action movie environment, that’s a breath of fresh air.

A camera strapped to the dashboard of a police cruiser makes a high-speed chase impressively compelling. The danger felt authentic in a way few buddy-cop movies ever do. But then you disobeyed the orders of the found footage genre, perfectly happy to operate without rhyme or reason for the rest of the movie.  Normally I’m not so forgiving about these types of artistic infractions. But there were enough redeemable qualities in David Ayer’s latest L.A.P.D. ride-along that I’m going to let you off the hook. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Brian Taylor, a beat cop who is constantly shooting himself with a camera (for a film class, we’re told) when he’s not shooting bad guys. He clips a recording device to himself and partner Mike Zavala’s (Michael Peña), and away we go. Early on, every shot is motivated and explained. You even managed that immersive trick of the actor pointing the camera at a mirror to have the audience believe your services weren’t even needed. Then maybe you got jealous that Gyllenhaal would actually take the credit, because, for the rest of the film, you were all over the place. The story is all over the place, too, taking an episodic approach that doesn’t stick with any one single case that needs to be solved. The two officers (and your omnipresent crew) race from call-to-random-call, and, during this time, I was won over by the chemistry between the partners. Taylor longs for a meaningful relationship, which he thinks he’s found in Janet (Anna Kendrick), while Pena expels the virtues of having a big Mexican family. The first half of the film is filled with moments that endear us to both the profession and the people involved. The slow build, however, means the climactic events that follow, and the motivations that incite them, come a bit too late (though they do carry an impressive impact). The revenge sought by members of a street gang is truly punishing and parallels the aesthetic grittiness film. By this third act, any logic as to where or why there are cameras following the action completely evaporates, and it’s a credit to the performances that we don’t mind believing L.A. is full of George Hollidays. Why not? Ever since The Blair Witch Project, you camera operators have fought for ways to keep the handycam gimmick fresh and worthwhile. Cloverfield got it right, Chronicle came close, and most other attempts, from Apollo 18 to Project X, often end up cheating at crucial moments. However, it’s possible to make a film that’s so good that the audience will forgive a lack of commitment to the approach, as District 9 proved.  But that film was a fake documentary, a kissing cousin to found footage, which more fully embraces the presence of pursuant camera operators. End of Watch hopes that after five minutes we’ll just forget about the set-up and settle in with the crazy camera angles. I guess the gamble pays off, because eventually we do.  Over and out, Christopher Status: Air Mail (3.5/5)"},{"title":"TIFF: Blackbird","url":"/2012/09/25/blackbird","date":"2012-09-25 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Keith Currie, Gun Wrangler, Given your line of work, gun violence must be a difficult reality for you. What was it like working on Blackbird, a film about a school shooting that never actually happens? Films like Elephant or We Need To Talk About Kevin want to show carnage and victims and death, but Blackbird means to discuss a larger picture about the subject: the bullying, the judgment, and the hysteria behind empty threats and passionate, ill-fated cries for help. These are things that writer/director Jason Buxton wants to talk about, and I’m guessing you appreciate that. Surely you’ve heard of “Chekhov’s Gun” - the idea that if you introduce a firearm in the opening act of a story, it must be fired later in the narrative. Otherwise, what would be the point of its existence? Blackbird doesn’t truly deviate from this philosophy, as we see a rifle go off in the film’s first act. You were no doubt there, behind the scenes, as the woefully-misunderstood Sean Randall (Connor Jessup) is on a hunting trip with his father. It was an important moment, as it shows Randall is uncomfortable with killing innocent life when given the opportunity to do so. He doesn’t shoot the deer. And yet, Sean is made out to be a psychopath in his small-town community. After a series of incidents with the douchebag hockey jocks at school – some of them involving death threats towards Sean – our protagonist becomes fed up, ranting to his only friend over instant messaging about how he’d like to shoot them in retaliation. Naturally, these threats are shown to the proper authorities, and when combined with Sean’s gothic appearance and dark taste in music, a judge sends him to straight to juvie. Your safeguarding expertise was probably also beneficial at the correctional facility. There’s a lot of fighting and violence there, too, as Sean becomes subjected to another kind of bullying. Thankfully, these scenes are handled with commendable control, excellent cinematography, and a surprising amount of reserve. It must have been amazing to watch Buxton, a first-time feature filmmaker, shoot with such dominance. Because there aren’t many guns in Blackbird, your job as weapons master was probably over and through fairly quickly. But don’t think your work isn’t appreciated! This is part of the film’s strength. Blackbird is a refreshing take on the school shooting subject, because we find resolve through talking things through with patient determination. We know the truth will soon fly free, and Jessup’s performance is strong enough to carry the entire film on his shoulders…even if his character gets a little stale here and there. I must admit that what you do is impressive. Your job requires a fair amount of restraint – the film industry is obsessed with guns and weapons, and you probably feel like a babysitter most of the time. You keep the dangerous toys under your watch at all times. I feel like too many people disrespect the proper safety guidelines when it comes to owning a gun, which is why I applaud individuals like you. Some call you a wrangler - but I call you a hero.

He got himself onstage on the final night of last month’s Republican National Convention, arguably the make-or-break moment of Mitt Romney’s political career. He did it without, apparently, a script—or really much of a plan for what was going to come out of his mouth. That kind of influence extends far beyond the sortof Hollywood clout that allows him, at a whim, to green-light a movie. But this isn’t a letter about Clint. It’s about the corruptive nature of absolute power. The kind of power that was passed down to you by The Artist Formerly Known as Josey Wales, power that you, Geoffrey, wielded so eagerly as you were putting together the cast for the baseball drama Trouble With The Curve. With this power, you were able to draft, from a pool of Hollywood heavy-hitters, a team of actors that reads like a roster of Hollywood’s most dependable supporting players: John Goodman, Robert Patrick—I’ll even throw Matthew Lillard in there, who seems somehow more substantial than he was when he slurred his way through the first Scream film. And who wouldn’t want these guys onscreen, if only to lend a bit of credibility to the proceedings? However, in filling out the rest of the cast, you did precisely what one might expect. If you asked me who might perfectly play the aging baseball scouts who hang out with Clint Eastwood in the rickety first-base bleachers of a small North Carolina town, I likely would have picked from the ether of memory the police captain from True Romance, and, let’s say, oh, the police captain from Basic Instinct. And, sure enough, there they are onscreen: Ed Lauter and Chelcie Ross, two of the most familiar That-Guy!s in Hollywood. If you’d asked me to choose a pair of dispassionate white male corporate executives who fold their hands and sigh and transmit information via squinty sidelong glances from opposite ends of a boardroom table, my brain would probably conjure the faces of the evil warden from Shawshank Redemption and, oh, I don’t know, Assistant District Attorney Irwin Bernstein from Hill Street Blues. Sure enough: Bob Gunton and George Wyner show up too. These guys are all pros. They’ve been playing roles like this for decades. Half a century, some of them! But, Geoff, is populating the frame with the most familiar faces supposed to be your job? In Trouble, you’ve made the most obvious casting choices. The same way screenwriter Randy Brown has transcribed the most recognizable dialogue in service of the most worn-out plot (aging baseball scout comes to terms with changing game, ambitious careerwoman must choose between family and a promotion, failed minor-league player deals with disappointment). The same way, too, the musical score hits the most conspicuous emotional beats, and the straightforward cinematography captures everything necessary and nothing more. The movie is, itself, obvious. All the choices you’ve made are the right choices. Nothing wrong, at all, with the faces and voices you’ve chosen to populate this fictional world—except that they’re so obviously fictional. We are aware, throughout every frame of film, that we are watching a movie. And for a picture that clearly aspires to evoke some very real emotions, this sort of perfunctory obviousness produces, instead, emotional passivity. In the end, it’s just a movie. Actors reading lines. In front of cameras. Overwhelmingly functional. A thick sheen of competence. Inaccessible. By the numbers, to a fault.  And that’s the sort of freedom that absolute power gives you: to make choices without risk, which are, invariably, the most boring choices to make.

Dr. Dan Streetmentioner’s Time Traveler’s Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations is the only respectable work to deal directly with this issue. But you also set a new standard for serious time travel study by making the film Primer, which is why Looper director Rian Johnson wisely consulted you on such matters. Now it’s my turn. I’ve had some trouble conjugating my description of his film, and I wanted to run this by you. It’s important, because the future enjoyment of an entire readership is at stake. They must willan-have to mayan seen this movie. They willan love it. Here’s my time-and-space bending paradox. I need to describe a film that smart people will definitely have to have seen in the future. In that future, they will watch the movie about Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who is a Looper, an assassin that will have killed people from even further in the future. That will become complicated when he is assigned to kill his future self (Bruce Willis) that will have come back to the future. That’s because it will have triggered a specific clause in his contract to somewhat later result in their murder by his eventually-to-be employer (Jeff Daniels) from the future. Along the way to their respective futures and futures-past, the Joes meet Sara (Emily Blunt) and Cid (a both now and surely later amazing Pierce Gagnon) who may change their future even more dramatically. So this is what I have so far*: Dear Dear Cast and Crew Reader, thank you for your support that you have given and will-haven given. I willen haven congratulen you on your fine taste with has on-brought you here over and over again and to haven on-seen Looper.

I just want people to understand the few complicated bits so that they can sit back and enjoy a great action-romance-thriller without worrying about the grammar. That should do the trick, right?

Some movies do it by grabbing you by the lapels and driving its proverbial forehead through yours. Others just sit in the corner, crying, and guilting you into asking “What’s wrong?” For a Good Time, Call… dumps a bunch of brightly colored Skittles in your hands, cranks the tunes, gives you a smirk, slaps your ass, and hollers, “Let’s go ride ponies!” And lo, I did believe. Your job is to help make this happen. Every little visual detail on set needs to contribute—anything out of place can hinder our belief. It’s your job to smooth them out, make these little filmmaking necessities go unnoticed. Sounds bad, I know, but I was looking for faults. I almost couldn’t believe that a movie this slight could carry me along so easily. The plot is very straightforward. College acquaintances Lauren (Lauren Miller) and Katie (Ari Graynor) share an unfortunate incident that causes them to instantly dislike each other.  The harsh financial realities of living in NYC motivate them to swallow their pride and move into together. This allows them to make ends meet and to start to become friends. Further job troubles occur, one thing leads to another, and the two start a phone sex business together. Hilarity ensues, friendships are built, troubles arise, and all are overcome. The movie itself seems to constantly paper over the conflicts, as if they were obligations that simply need to be fulfilled. It is always eager to get back to the colors and kinetics that are the real stars of the show. Miller and Graynor are a treat to watch. They float from scene to scene and dart between plot points, never getting weighed down by drama and never letting the unseemly subject matter seem smutty or base. Seth Rogen’s cameo, of course, being the exception – he alone slows the pace down just enough to make it all seem gross. The others are having fun all the way through, and so was I. Besides you, Sarah, I credit director Jamie Travis for giving this movie such a clear and unique tone. Another indie-turned-studio director might insist on the vérité or gritty angle to the story. Instead, Travis headed in the opposite direction, taking the strengths of the set-up as far as they would go, wrapping them in those bright candy colors and happy smiles. Wow, listen to me. I was surprised and not the least bit disappointed. I sat down and watched a movie that was fun and light, but without any of the shortcuts or sad societal clichés that make me want to tear my hair out. Call me anytime.

But things happen, amiright? So your movie takes six years to get made. Happens all the time. Sure you had six different directors. The Hobbit had almost as many. You needed five writers. The best thing to do is just to mix it up, keep it loose. Throw in a little bit of what anyone could want: love, a little drama, monsters, wordplay, and slapstick. Some 3-frickin’-D. Wrap it up with rap song. I tell ya, every single person will enjoy Hotel Transylvania. For like five minutes, at least. Sure, that means that they’ll be bored or annoyed for the rest of the 86 minutes, but them’s the breaks. We’re in a recession, after all. You’ve got a nice setup. You’ve got a single dad whose daughter’s all grown up. He wants to protect her, literally building a fortress hotel to keep her safe forever. But there’s friction - she wants to go out and experience the world for herself. That can be the toughest moment in a man’s life, with a lot of conflicting emotions. And he’s hiding some deep hurt from his past. But hey! Enough of that. Because he’s Dracula! And there’re hilarious monsters that are staying at the hotel. There’s Frankenstein in pieces! Zombies! Fran Drescher! There’s a mummy that gets blamed for a rancid fart that cooks the hotel help. Hilarious! Then this schmuck shows up uninvited and takes a shine to the daughter and it might just be mutual. This intruder forces Dracula to face his fears for his daughter, his own personal pain, and why he has created a safe haven for kin and kindred. How can he deal with this threat to his identity, family, and friends? Woooh! Did you know that Beethoven is sooo old and dead? And boring? Rock music is what everyone needs! You trade up the deep stuff for some crowd pleasing fun as fresh as an 80s movie. A lotta people like something familiar.  It might not appeal to anyone who’s ever seen a movie since, but maybe a lot of people haven’t. And those are the people that are going to love some of this. You got some real comedic pros in the cast - Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, Steve Buschemi, Molly Shannon, David Spade, Jon Lovitz, and Chris Parnell. But just so everyone feels invited, you got Selena Gomez and Ceelo Green. It’s a nice bunch that doesn’t lean too far in any one direction. Since no one likes a smart-ass, the movie also has everyone laugh at their own jokes. Every single one. That’s a great nod to the people who are totally bored by the mid-life crisis plot.  And to the really small children who need to see people laughing to know it’s all fun and games. Maybe it undermines the chance for any thinking person over the age of six to enjoy the jokes, but hey, they get Buschemi as a werewolf dad who hates his life. Some people will be really happy that this is an animated feature with none of the irredeemably evil villains that kid’s movies and Mel Gibson films are made of. But then those people will hate the long extended pointless action scenes and grotesquely oversimplified love story. Some people will appreciate the loving homages to Tex Avery cartoons. Those people will hate the hacky 3D. Everyone gets their turn, just like Warhol said. So just take it and be grateful. In these times, we all gotta be economical.

Today’s biggest musical stars are like you—less concerned with writing something new, more interested in putting their own spin on old hits. A cappella groups epitomize this trend. But the technique only works if the performers (and in your case, re-recorders) are able to elevate the material. In movies terms, the same can be said about remakes and genre films. By those standards, Pitch Perfect has too many formulaic beats to risk being original, but it does a fine job remixing the standard musical comedy.  The bassline is as common as they come: a young, good-looking misfit comes to a new school and looks for a way to fit in. Her singing talents are hidden, because her first passion is to be a mixmaster (like you, Steve) who mashes up other the work of other artists. But at the behest of her father (what a twist!), she joins The Bellas. They’re an all-female singing group that is a greatest hits mix-tape of high school outcast-types: there’s the quiet Asian, the all-attitude African-American, the slutty sexpot, the uptight control freak, and the overweight comedic relief. Sounds familiar, but I guess that’s the appeal of a remix. There’s a love story of course, and tension around keeping everyone together. But, like a good mash-up, it’s the mixing of two divergent performances that make the film work. First, the understated approach of Anna Kendrick as the emotionally detached Bella, whose initial too-cool attitude rings true. She is contrasted with Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), a bombastic Aussie who encourages said nickname so “twig bitches” don’t say it behind her back. Where Bella embodies a withdrawn skepticism of the inherent clichés, Fat Amy embraces them unapologetically (and wins us over in the process). Kendrick plays her character straight, never coming across as pouty or petty, while Wilson proves she has an ear for comedy and is this year’s breakout performer, following in the footsteps of Melissa McCarthy in Bridesmaids. Aside from the deft humour, the musical performances are also infectiously in-tune. A vocal riff-off between the Treble Makers and rival groups blends musical styles into entertaining melodies, and it’s during these interludes that the music is best able to influence the development of character. By the finale, most of the boxes have been checked, and we’re able to sit back and enjoy the harmonies (plus at least one magic moment that sneaks itself into the story). By and large, you gained my approval. But, Steve—would it really kill you to drop an unexpected beat on us every now and then? And no, that awkward, sequel-inspiring cut-off sentence at the end of the film doesn’t count.

Or are you the type of gal who threatens to “ground up like pepper” your misbehaving shame-baby? No, these rather hilarious and random lines are from the twisted minds of Picnicface, the online comedy troupe behind Roller Town. You, on the other hand, are simply one of the many donors who helped make their big screen debut possible. The other self-credited benefactors include raptor tamers, fruit hypnotizers, and pepperoni stick samurais. And if any of you had actually showed up on-set, you undoubtedly would have been included in this everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink-plus-the-hair-in the-drain comedy. Roller Town is a tour-de-farce by Generation YouTube’s Canadian wunderkinds. Picnicface got their own Comedy Network TV series, but stepping into film is always much more daunting (as their forebears from like Saturday Night Live and The Kids in the Hall can attest). Rarely can specialists in short-form humor successfully stretch a skit over an hour and a half. Well, I LOL’ed – for real – multiple times. So something obviously worked. The year is 1970-something, and disco isn’t just dying, it’s being murdered. No-nonsense arcade pushers are forcing Mouth Wheel machines (aka Pac-Man) into the small town roller discos of Canada. They’re doing more than just killing the funk—they’re killing people, and even themselves, to prove how ridiculously serious they are. The only man brave enough to roll up against them is Leo (Mark Little), a defiant skater who for some reason is constantly, humiliatingly, rejected by the Royal Roller Academy.  Now he gets a chance to finally prove his groove. Along the way, he also attempts to win over Julia (Kayla Lorette), the girl of his dreams. And there you have it: all the mandatory plot points to ride out a feature film. But who cares? It’s the random stops along the way that make this film worthwhile. Leo’s facemashing during a makeout session with Julia. The seven belts Grandpa wears over his sweatpants. A hobo corn-fucker hiding in the fields. And, of course, the musical disco interludes. These are just a few arbitrary examples of what, against all logic, worked for me. The film as a whole suffers from numerous trappings of a low budget feature: the sound design is weak, the cinematography is inconsistent, and the scale always feels limited. But when it comes to comedy, there’s only one objective measurement that matters. Laughter. And more than a few jokes land right where they’re supposed to. Even the romance manages a strange brew of chemistry. I’ll be damned if I didn’t fall for Julia’s crooked smile by the end of it all. So check your watch, brave supporter, and sing along with me: “It’s a quarter to dick. It’s a half past pussy. It’s fuck o’clock!”. No? Not random enough for you?

Especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where ongoing attacks have claimed the most casualties since World War II. But you’re part of a film crew, not a rebel army, and your method of capturing children only required a camera, legal consent forms, and resulted in festival-season accolades and awards. It’s a nice change of pace. In fact, recruiting non-professional actors is a big reason War Witch (Rebelle, original French title) is one of the most beautiful and chilling films of the year. It’s hard to imagine a more harrowing premise than this: a 14-year-old girl named Komona (Rachel Mwanza) explains to her unborn child how she came to be a child soldier: forced to kill her parents, raped into pregnancy, and now looking for the strength to avoid drowning the soon-to-be newborn. If that wasn’t enough, her captor keeps her close because he believes she has special powers that helped her be the sole survivor of a battle. Meanwhile, a persecuted albino and rebel ally named Magician (Serge Kanyinda) wants to run off with her.  But getting away is a lot more complicated than just signing a release form. From the opening frames, the tatters of a UNHCR banner tells us that “help” from the outside world has come and gone. Instead, the Congolese now channel voodoo with rocks and rattles to summon relief, barter with totems for personal protection, and follow superstitious beliefs in their pursuit personal goals. Those supernatural elements are rooted in African legend, but are always presented as a seamless expression of a character’s emotions. The film, by extension, melds dreams to motivations and nightmares to traumas with stunning effect. As an audience, we’re at the mercy of a child’s perspective. At times we’re caught in a deadly sleepwalk—just  like Komona herself experiences. Even though her daily reality is that she’s trapped in a jungle army, fighting other innocents for food, her most painful prison is clearly psychological. War Witch also proves that writer and director Kim Nguyen is one of the most wonderfully unpredictable voices in Canadian cinema. Certainly a departure from his black and white sci-fi comedy Truffle, and only superficially similar to his period drama The City about European combat doctor in North Africa, Nguyen has made exponential progress as a filmmaker. Attention to detail is a particular strength, as he crafts iconic and haunting images that always feel relevant to the story. He also finds an elegant way to handle distasteful material in what might be the most personally punishing rape-revenge scene ever filmed.  From the pre-partum depression onwards, Nguyen finds ways for the audience to digest the disturbing material and come out the other side feeling hopeful. Good thing, because the audience may love the film, but they’d hate to be trapped in this world.

I hope this letter finds you well. I’m writing to you in hopes of learning more about the program you’re offering. I was at the local movie house recently and watched the newsreel documentary The Master, which reported on your curative relationship with the troubled drifter Freddie Quell. While I am not a naval veteran like Mr. Quell, and suffer only from mild versions of the sexual psychoses and alcoholic crackups that he does, I nonetheless believe that the psychological processing you put him through would be beneficial on my journey towards self-actualization. You see, Freddie and I seek the same things in life: a coherent narrative, a few satisfying surprises, and perpetual aesthetic joy. And that is evidently what you offer, Mr. Dodd. And so I will state my intentions plainly: I would like to become a member of The Cause. I can assure you that my mind is wide open to new and exciting ways of exploring the spiritual world. Particularly the type of immortal cosmic adventuring you so eloquently promote. To be honest, I think I would make a much better companion than Mr. Quell. I’m much less erratic in my behavior, and much less prone to sudden outbursts of wild-eyed violence (and flatulence). He certainly is an odd fellow, wouldn’t you say? He doesn’t walk, but shambles. He doesn’t speak, but grumbles. With his narrow shoulders and scarred face, he seems, in his physical presence alone, a proxy for the dark side of post-war America. The verve with which he performs his heedless antagonisms is almost frightening. Yet, he is perhaps the most fascinating fellow I’ve met all year. I wish Mr. Quell would have more clearly recognized the beauty inherent in the belief system you preach. The way you frame each scenario of your ecumenical mythology recalls a classical sort of visual design met with modern anarchistic perspectives. This is spiritual movement as high art. Immersive, subjective, sometimes lethargic, but ultimately edifying. I am very impressed. Please answer this letter by sending me whatever literature I should familiarize myself with in preparation of my Processing.

You walked on set every day yelling “Here Comes the Boom… Operator!” If not out loud, then certainly in your head. Maybe you were just too shy to make the joke in front of everyone. But why would you be? You were working on a Kevin James film, after all. Going for the obvious laughs is his bread and butter. He may have dialed it back a notch for Here Comes the Boom, but he didn’t replace slapstick antics for originality – just an octagon. For all the complaints I could level against the film, watching everything unfold isn’t nearly as punishing as what Kevin James’ overweight junior high biology teacher Scott Voss goes through. To save the school’s music program , he decides to try his hand at UFC fighting. A cause which seems noble enough, even as the script does its best to hide the his real motivation: to impress the school nurse, played by Salma Hayek. No matter what his character accomplishes, however, only the logic of movie magic can explain how she succumbs to James’ gravitational pull (it’s certainly not magnetic). And as James (as himself) awkwardly points out in a brief pre-movie clip, we’ll all learn a nice life lesson about never giving up by the end of the film. Joel, I hope you weren’t caught snickering when you recorded that cheese-tastic soundbite. You don’t want to upset the boss. Unlike Mr. Voss, who gets his signature song, “Boom” by D.O.A., stolen from him by a competitor, no one risks upstaging Kevin James in the film—no matter how low-key he makes the comedy. A few adult students in his evening citizenship class come close (including real-life MMA fighter Bas Rutten), but there’s simply no gut-punch laughs to be had. A few light jabs here and there, but nothing that will knock you too the floor. A film like this should take a cue from its lead character and do something brave, just for one scene. Have us believe you’re bobbing left, then hit us with a right. Instead it’s a whole lot of here-comes-the-fat, here-comes-the-training, here-comes-the-hero.

It’s entertainment, so no one’s complaining—well, except for researchers like you. In your line of work, fudging the facts might be disastrous. But for Tony Mendez and the six American diplomats trying to sneak out of Iran during the revolution of 1979, getting a detail wrong would have been deadly. We feel those consequences to maximum effect in Argo, a masterfully suspenseful dramatization of the now-declassified rescue mission, reconstructed with incredible period detail by you and director Ben Affleck. The vintage Warner Brother’s logo fades into a condensed history of Iran, helping us non-history-buffs catch up on the sociopolitical mood of Iran in the late 70s. The technique works beautifully, employing illustrated storyboards, that pre-production staple, to foreshadow the upcoming film-centric story. Six Americans have escaped the overrun U.S. embassy, taking refuge at the Canadian Ambassador’s home with now way out until CIA operative Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) cooks up a plan for them to pose as a Canadian film crew. The stakes are sky-high, not just for the individuals involved, but for two countries teetering on the edge of war. To make this cover story believable, Mendez does you proud by doing his research. He flies to L.A. to start up a production office and recruits the help of some Hollywood handy men played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin, who offer wonderful moments of comedic reprieve. As a director, Affleck strikes a perfect balance, never undermining the importance of the trip by getting too silly, and drawing the audience in with compelling inter-character drama. When things ramp up, we see the Iranians literally piecing together clues, even using child labor to assemble shredded documents. It’s an archeological-level excavation that needs to be completed in days, not years, and would probably put most academics to shame. Research by both factions is ratcheted up to a breakingpoint until it skillfully unravels. The tension is made more powerful for those us unfamiliar with the real-life details by your commitment to putting them onscreen. Of course, even if we know the broad strokes (Affleck had no problem spelling those out at the TIFF premiere), it’s a credit to everyone involved that the overall drama is always credible. Of course, retelling history with emotional textures requires a certain flair that research alone cannot provide. Just like the characters themselves, you need imagination and informed invention to fill in the gaps. But unlike the Iranian Imperial Guard, I have no interest in checking your sources. I did, however, appreciate the final credit sequence that offers a side-by-side comparisons of actors with the real-life people they portrayed and shows the perfect replicas created by the production design team.

You stare into the darkness and the darkness stares into you.  Like Stephen King, you cobble together your disparate, very personal fears and build a story that will frighten strangers. You work carefully and quietly with your darlings. But things can go wrong. In Sinister, they go from strong beginnings to SLASH CRASH BLARGH. All the precious darlings are DEAD. How did this happen? It’s a mystery with twist at the end.  Let’s look at the victims to understand the horror. First, you have your main protagonist Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), who is lovingly crafted as a “true crime” writer who may already have his best successes behind him. His is a universal fear, making it a wonderful driver for the plot. In a last-ditch effort to rekindle his career, he moves his family to a new town and home with the goal of writing a new book. His research takes a dark turn when he discovers evidence never found by the police. But then this pretty great setup is turned…and devoured. Oswalt proceeds to do so many things out of character that he is no longer compelling or even sympathetic. It’s as if by some dark design that your work is put down.  Just as Oswalt tilts almost to the point of deserving death, he then pulls back and becomes sort of sympathetic. In the end, you feel sort of “meh” about him. Who would turn your carefully crafted hero into this cretin, this narratively dead thing?               The next victim is fear itself. We are physical animals, with a highly-tuned limbic system that makes us fight or fly when we are scared. A sudden noise from the darkness can dissolve our pretense of higher-order being. This fear-trigger is the undying companion for any horror movie. And yet, someone or something in Sinister methodically, mercilessly murders it. Every single time the beating soundscape and fast-paced scene cuts take a pause, it is followed by a loud surprising jump cut and loud noise. The relentless predictability turns the initial genuine terror into irritation and annoyance. As the movie accelerates, the casualties pile up. Each one is a surprise. Japanese Horror’s fear and fascination with media bludgeoned with an old-ish film projector. Who could have done this? I wonder.  Next it’s our natural suspicion of small children, alien beings with whom we have only a passing understanding. Even they are put down, smothered by a strong controlling hand with some bad art and silly face paint. By this time, it’s clear who the culprit is. It’s the director. In his zeal to make a commercially viable and broad horror movie, he has betrayed everything interesting that his writer gave him. He has swallowed up the movie with irrelevance and annoyance.

It’s a smart way to sell tickets, but it also ends up hurting the film.  I should start by saying what’s wrong has nothing to do with the premise. Writer and director Rubba Nada comes by her interest in the Middle East honestly. Her Syrian and Palestinian roots have noticeably informed her previous inter-personal films. In her sixth feature, she attempts a thriller, but can’t seem to shake her habit of cooking up a slow brewing drama. The entire handling of the set-up does nothing to frame our expectations for an action film, even if it will half-heartedly turn in that direction. And as you probably realized when sorting through promotional images, that’s the problem. The film only finds a pulse when it adheres to the thriller genre.  A film about a former spy returning to a country with a bounty on his head should have no trouble seeding tension. Instead, the early scene where Adib (Alexander Siddig) illegally crosses into Syria focuses almost exclusively on a long-faded romantic reunion with Fatima (Marissa Tomei). Okay, fine. Not every film can handle a border crossing with the expertise of Argo. But what’s happens next? Will he start putting together a list of old foes who may have kidnapped his daughter and are holding her for revenge? Will he use his extensive undercover skills to weed them out one by one? Nope, he casually checks into the Canadian embassy and meets a diplomat named Paul (Joshua Jackson) to ensure his own personal safety. Very responsible of him. As they calmly sit and talk, surrounded by a picture of the Queen, Stephen Harper and a painting by the Group of Seven, we start to realize just how un-Hollywood the film actually is.  Shots linger too long, dialogue is needlessly repeated and the music tries to build suspense when the script can’t. Then, after cross-cutting one too many times to a home video of his daughter, we get a few character reveals that become interesting. But when the pace picks up, the already sparse chase scenes feel cut short. Our hero Adib even gets crafty by improvising a weapon, and at one point karate chops himself out of trouble, but it’s all much more exciting on paper than on film. I guess that’s your fault. I understand why you have to put the film’s best foot forward to fill seats. But it also feels like the rest of the crew, from the sound designers to camera department, were itching to make a different kind of film. The director was just too reluctant to go far enough in that direction. What we get isn’t bad, but I couldn’t help noticing what’s missing instead of enjoying what’s on screen.

If a set dresser tells you to drag a corpse around, you ask how far. If a decorator decides they need more blood up a wall, you ask how high. You do all the art department’s last minute dirty deeds without question, not unlike the poor title character in Eddie: The Sleepwalking Cannibal. But if you ever feel like turning against your gentle masters, think twice before chewing them out. You never know: they might be using you to accomplish a greater good, like producing a dementedly entertaining black comedy. Then again, they could just be selfish artists using you to keep their own hands clean. That’s the case with Lars (Thure Lindhardt), a brilliant Danish painter going through an artistic dry spell. He ends up in the backwoods of Canada to clear his head and teach at a tiny art school. But when he’s guilted into housing a simple-minded roommate named Eddie (Dylan Smith), he discovers an unlikely and incredibly violent inspiration – a sleepwalking cannibal. Cheaper than hiring a personal swing gang, I suppose, but it’s also a lot messier. What begins as an unorthodox means of clearing up his painter’s block, turns into a personal puppet that does some unseemly bidding—all in the service of artistic integrity, of course. Well, at least initially. The film itself is certainly no masterwork (nor does it try to be) but the broad strokes are pretty damn amusing. Part of the appeal is that writer and director Boris Rodriguez has a good handle on tone. Rather than creating an all-out gore fest or exploitation piece, the story eases its way into mayhem. Eddie himself, for example, slowly eats his way up the food chain – from rabbits, to dogs, to an eventual house full of humans. It’s a horror-comedy mix that is hard to pull-off outside the hands of Sam Raimi, but mostly succeeds here because of Smith’s empathetic portrayal of the mute murdering muse, and Lindhardt’s strange brand of anti-hero (a physical resemblance to Simon Pegg doesn’t hurt, either). Without exploring the concept in any meaningful way, the film also grazes the surface of social commentary and the way artists exploit the suffering of others for personal benefit. No one is more guilty of this than filmmakers themselves, where every serial killer is almost guaranteed to be portrayed in some type of made-for-TV movie at the very least. But this is man bites man, not Man Bites Dog, and the film’s ambitions are not nearly as provocative. Regardless, I’d be weary of those bosses if I were you. You never know what they’ll make you do in the name of art.

Because – and I’m taking a bit of a guess about the additional sound you mixed – but I’m willing to bet that it was Macy Gray’s voiceover. There are two things that lead me to this conclusion:  first, the movie would make no sense without her explaining – in convenient bullet-point style – every plot incident that Daniels forgot to actually show. And second: the voice over itself makes no sense. Like, at all. Let me incept you for a moment: Gray’s character, Anita, is being interviewed about a book; a book written about the events surrounding a Sherriff’s murder in 1969. This is three minutes into the film. She’s a maid in the Jansen home, where Patriarch W.W. (Scott Glenn) and his son Jack (Zac Efron) run a local newspaper in a backwater Florida town. Semi-famous Miami Times writer (and fellow family member) Ward (Matthew McConaughey) returns with his writing partner Yardley (David Oyelowo) to investigate the aforementioned murder. This is all initiated by Charlotte Bless (Nicole Kidman), a serial correspondent of death row inmates, convinced that Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack) is innocent. So, how does Anita fit into all of this? She doesn’t, actually. Her character seems to exist as a conscience for Jack—and, of course, to provide some commentary on race relations in 1960s Florida. As a narrator, though, she does some pretty amazing things. Her insights into the story and the characters are near-omniscient. Based on what she recounts, she can do the following (described here in in convenient bullet-point style): It’s a shame that Daniels forced you to mix in all of this expositional nonsense, because, without it, the film might have been a lot more interesting. What could have worked as a Goddard-like exercise in storytelling – treating elliptically what is traditionally considered vital in terms of tone, character, and narrative – instead reveals a director too timid (or incompetent) to tell the story as originally filmed. In the process, a number of good performances (Kidman, McConaughey, and Cusack) don’t amount to much. It seems that Daniels used you compromise his own vision, and I like that version of the film a whole lot more.

I understand how people go blurry-eyed playing video games, exploring every corner of a digital universe with zombie-like devotion for days on end. But have you ever tried to watch someone else play? For even 15 minutes? The tedium that overwhelms you when you’re powerless over the arbitrary decisions of others is another parallel that the gaming world has with Silent Hill: Revelation. If I wore contacts, they’d be permanently lodged deep inside my cranium after how long, hard, and often my eyes rolled during this pointless, meandering, comically terrible snoozefest. When something works in genre films – as the first Silent Hill did (but only mildly) – it becomes necessary in today’s economic model to mine your property for any and all additional profit. In this case, we are left with Heather, the surviving daughter of Silent Hill’s heroine, now played by Michelle Williams lookalike Adelaide Clemens. She walks around with no skills and no clue, like an annoying little sister your parents force you to play the game with. Sean Bean also returns as the father, and is once again criminally underused. Instead, fellow Game of Thrones castmate Kit Harrington joins the cast as a mysterious outsider in a performance that solidifies his place in any conversation about the worst actor of our generation. Unless, of course, the titular “revelation” is that the film is actually a comedy, in which case Harrington nails it. That’s the first problem: the entire concept of the film is too trippy to be scary. It begins with the yawn-inducing horror standard – a dream inside a dream – and doubles down on that concept by constantly shifting out of reality. All without visceral triggers or consequences. Instead of feeling invested in the horror, we just sit back and watch as the walls peel away, or monsters fight themselves, while the “hero” cower in corners and slip from away to the next “level”. The effort that went into creating these piecemeal scenes is admirable, but the way we experience them are simply dreadful. The lights are always set to “strobe”, the dialogue is groan-inducing, and simple shots (like the ones on the Welcome to Silent Hill sign) linger a painfully long time. The town itself, which perpetually rains ash thanks to an underground fire, is a great visual conceit, but rendered gimmicky by perfunctory effects that 3D glasses do nothing to improve.  Even those contact lenses you put in Alessa’s eyes just look like big boring black dots. Sorry. The only way in which this film improves on the first is the mercifully short runtime. Good thing, because I was ready to gouge my own eyes out.

Schnittker, Senior Software Engineer,   The system specifications you designed for Wreck-It Ralph are solid. Fed up with the repetition and drudgery of his day job, a block-headed coin-op arcade video game villain goes rogue in an attempt to win the accolades and attention that are, by nature of his programming, beyond his reach. Classic redemption story. You have a linear journey with an integrated end-goal: Ralph proceeds to invade the other arcade games and unwittingly puts all of the machines in danger of being put out of order (the video game equivalent of an extinction-level-event). If only there was more to it than that.  When Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) first leaves his Mario-inspired platform jumper home, he ends up in a light-gun game called Hero’s Duty. Here the film acknowledges that it takes place in a world much like ours, where friendly Italian pipe-fitters have given way to death-dealing super-soldiers. In placing an old-school character like Ralph in the middle of a hyperkinetic first-person shooter, it seemed the film might have something meaningful to say about the way children entertain themselves, and how much the mood and tenor of that entertainment has changed in the last twenty years. As much as this is a story about Ralph and Felix (voiced by Jack McBrayer) losing their innocence as they question the limitations imposed by their predestined roles as villain and hero, it also could have been a story of innocence lost on a much broader scale. Unfortunately, that thread is never really followed.  I suppose you could argue that the beetle-creatures Ralph unintentionally smuggles out of Hero’s Duty are some sort of metaphor for the threatening influence of a newer, more cynical, type of games. But Wreck-It Ralph, sadly, doesn’t have such ambitions. No, there aren’t that many layers between the hardware and the end-user. The software architecture, here, is pretty simple.  We get a few fun cameos from classic video game characters (who, let’s be honest, the target audience of this film is too young to recognize by at least a decade), but with the entire history of video games to explore, I have to admit I was disappointed by how much time was spent lingering in the kart racing game Sugar Rush. And not just because the vibrant design of the candy-inspired racetrack world gave my eyeballs diabetes. Ralph is there to train his sidekick, the glitchy tyke Vanellope Von Swchweetz (Sarah Silverman, whose sometimes-endearing nails-on-chalkboard delivery is, here, has a certainn ear-bleeding quality), ). By the end of it all, after the secret princesses and megalomaniacal villains have been revealed, we’ve learned some pretty typical lessons about friendship and loyalty and believing in yourself and learning to love yourself for who you are. There’s nothing new in this code.  Wreck-It Ralph is good. It works. It’s functional. But it’s a perfect example of how a half-developed idea can’t be corrected after the fact with advanced algorithms and detailed documentation. No, even in software engineering you have to be bold to be great.  Sincerely,  Jared Young Status: Standard Delivery (3/5)"},{"title":"Flight","url":"/2012/11/02/flight","date":"2012-11-02 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":"Dear Craig Hosking, Pilot, In the first act of the new film Flight – Robert Zemeckis’s first live-action effort since Castaway – a jumbo jet goes careening nose-first towards the populous flatlands of middle-America, and bon-vivant pilot Whip Witaker (played by Denzel Washington), half-drunk on screwdrivers and buzzing with cocaine, must execute a spectacular, logic-defying (though plausible—right, Craig?) aerial maneuver in order to save the day. There are no scenes of flying after these initial aeronautic acrobatics, but I sense that your influence extended beyond simply coordinating the takeoffs and landings of support craft. Since the late-80s remake of The Blob, you’ve contributed your piloting skills to virtually every notable film production of the last twenty-five years: from epic action films like The Dark Knight Rises to small-town comedies like Groundhog Day. You know better than anyone that flight is all about managing the interaction of opposing forces: gravity and propulsion; roll, pitch, and yaw. Get it right and the miracle of flight occurs as naturally for a jet airplane as it does for a bird. Get it wrong and 900,000 pounds of metal tumbles from the sky. Robert Zemeckis has much to learn from someone like you. He faces a crisis of control similar to Captain Whitaker, and I wish he had handled it with equal grace. Maybe you could teach him a thing or two about working the stick.  See what I did there? The captain of a plane? The director of a film? I hate to indulge too deeply in such an easy metaphor, but the way Flight unfolds makes it unavoidable. The opposing forces Zemeckis struggles to mitigate are tonal. The tension between his attempt to breach darker spaces (indeed, there is more nudity, profanity, and drug use in the first five minutes of the film than in the entirety of Zemeckis’s three decade body of work) and his congenital earnestness constantly threatens to incite laughter. There are two films occurring simultaneously, here: a fairly interesting investigative drama about the politics of blame in the aftermath of tragedy, and, woven through it, a 70s-era movie-of-the-week about the horrors of alcoholism.  This is clear from the start, as the crash that sets the narrative going is awkwardly intercut with scenes of a troubled young woman scoring drugs on the set of a porno flick (executed by Zemeckis with the sort of faux-cool bravado a desperate dad might try to muster in front of his teenage daughter’s friends). There’s no harmony between the rising suspense of a jet airliner falling from the stratosphere and the quiet beats of a junkie preparing to shoot up. Craig, you should have told Zemeckis that you can’t roll left and yaw right if you want a smooth take-off.  But Zemeckis isn’t the only one fighting to unite two very different atmospheres. When Whitaker, post-crash, is forced to confront his drinking problem, Washington conjures a bit of the dangerous, pursed-lip cockiness that earned him an Oscar for Training Day—but in Flight it’s tempered by age: Denzel is still Denzel, but Denzel is getting old. He’s bloated, greying, and that gives him a vulnerability that works well here. He is a man perpetually fighting to maintain control, and perpetually in danger of losing it.  However, as written, Whitaker is the kind of alcoholic you only see in the movies: he swigs straight from the bottle as he listens to Bill Withers and watches old home movies; he falls face-first onto coffee tables in slapstick style; he mumbles and laughs and points his bottle accusingly. It lacks nuance, subtlety. It’s completely anachronistic, and John Gatlin’s screenplay abandons Washington completely in the final scenes, when it descends, with out-loud evangelizing about “what it means to be truly free” and “what kind of man I truly am,” into a parody of Oscar-baiting Hollywood sentimentality.  And that, unfortunately, is where Zemeckis ends up. On familiar terrain. Whatever notions he might have had of saying something new, hinted at in those gritty early scenes, are abandoned completely. It’s a safe landing, but not the right destination.  Sincerely,  Jared Young Status: Junk Mail (1.5/5)"},{"title":"Nashville — Shownotes S01E04","url":"/2012/11/05/nashville-shownotes-s01e04","date":"2012-11-05 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Cast and Crew of Nashville, S1E04 – “We Live in Two Different Worlds” Episode synopsis:The arrival of a woman from Teddy’s past tests his marriage; Rayna and Deacon perform at Teddy’s fundraiser; Juliette appears on “Good Morning America;” and Gunnar connects with his publisher’s assistant.

The United States of 1969 could not accept (much less understand) the cardboard delivery coming out of a muscle-brained 22-year-old Austrian bodybuilder. It just shows us how much the world has changed­. In many ways, you have helped change it. Too bad there’s no going back to undo the disaster that is your first ever film role.

The entire plot is driven by your oft-repeated refrain: “Because I’m Hercules.” That mindless phrase takes you from Olympus to New York City. It takes you from a ship to a pretzel man on the docks, to some college athletes, to some gangsters, to… a television event? It makes no sense, and nobody probably cared. There are little moments where the dialogue raises above the muddle, and it makes me sympathize with the writer. But only a little bit. I am not sure how you survived this film. The whole history of cinema is littered with the aborted careers of people who tried to break into film. Success is rarely about whether they got a chance; it’s what they did with it once they got it. The choice of each film in a fledgling career can make or break you. So if this was your first big shot, your agent should be shot. Or maybe you didn’t’ care. Maybe you were capitalizing on past success. It’s like you took the smooth, smiling psychopath you would eventually play in Pumping Iron and made him a demigod. That may be a historically accurate Hercules, but not a very interesting one. Apparently the studio said that Hercules in New York “was not met with an overwhelming response from the public,” and tried to sell the rights on eBay years later.  You should have bought them, Mr. “Strong”, to keep it out of circulation forever.

She grew up in front of the camera, recently earned an Academy Award nomination behind the camera, and now she’s taking the camera even further. In her documentary Stories We Tell, Sarah puts the Polley family under investigation. She’s looking for answers (one in particular), and more importantly, a better understanding about her own identity. You kept the truth hidden for your entire life, and to our wonder, fascination, and delight, your youngest daughter tells the compelling tale. Some reviews for the film have revealed this mystery as if it’s a simple component necessary to the synopsis. But I’m going to take your lead and keep quiet. Instead, I’ll focus on all the other brilliant things I love about this very personal documentary. It starts with the film’s “personality”. That it doesn’t take itself too seriously (that wonderful Canadian attribute) shows confidence in the subject matter. It seems that Sarah – and others members of the family – often questioned the interest others had in exploring such personal questions. The frankness of some of the answers would probably make you blush, but of course, the more specific everyone gets, the more real you become to us strangers—and the more universal Sarah’s story becomes. This directorial approach also renders the film’s construction refreshingly transparent. We get some great candid moments as your friends and family prepare to be interviewed. We see your husband Michael recording a voiceover (a heartfelt and articulate piece of introspection that he composed himself); Sarah asks him to re-record lines, no matter how confident he is with the delivery. We also get a mixture of found and new footage, but the line between truth and fiction blurs as the film wears on.  That’s another wonderful revelation we learn over the course of the film. At one point, Sarah herself is asked what the film is really about. Her answer is a bit laboured and intellectual, touching on ideas of representation and identity. Of course the truth is much simpler, even if these themes are what make the film resonate.

From afar, the mythos might seem a rather weightless melange of gizmo fetishism and gratuitous ogling—and the lamest installments in the franchise certainly embrace that shallow doctrine. But the better iterations of Bond, in print and onscreen, are more than just macho male reveries. They’re stories about being alone. About isolation, physical and emotional. Ian Fleming’s novels, for all their passive racism and backwards sexual politics, are about a terribly lonely man who is always making poor decisions and finding himself reliant on his superhuman stubbornness to survive (often just barely).  Skyfall is the third film since the series rebooted in 2006 with bullet-headed Daniel Craig in the eponymous role, and it addresses these ideas of loneliness and abandonment more directly than any of the previous twenty-three flicks. Miraculously, it does this without ever becoming too self-serious or morose.  Despite providing the series with some of its darkest moments, Skyfall feels – in its grand embrace of everything that (for better or worse) has defined James Bond over the last half-century – like the most joyous, self-aware, cinematically coherent expression of Bond. Perhaps ever. So why am I writing this letter to you, Joss?  Because all of this positivity, ironically, was helped greatly by the stunning amount of guns you provided for the shoot.  Hey, wait, hold on. I hate guns as much as any effeminate liberal pseudo-intellectual. But as abominable as the use of firearms is in the real world, the pop of gunfire is the backbeat to which every modern action film finds its rhythm. And guns have always been integral to Bond folklore, from his MI6-issued Walther PPK to Scaramanga’s Golden Gun. A Bond film will always be the sum of its individual parts: the stunts, the action scenes, the sexy accented women. Skyfall boasts more than one sequence that, in any other respectable blockbuster, would be the adrenalized center-piece: a conflict with an assassin in a neon-lit Shanghai skyscraper; a fistfight in a komodo dragon pit; a rush-hour chase through London’s tube system; an assault on a crumbling estate in the Scottish highlands. In all of these scenes, guns play a prominent role. Futuristic sniper-rifles, old-timey pirate pistols, handguns with palm-print-recognition software—guns, particularly when they’re not fired, establish the life-or-death stakes. (It should be noted, too, that Bond films are helped or hindered exponentially by the quality of the antagonist, and here we get Javier Bardem in a performance that, in its twitchy, grinning bravado, perhaps owes something to Heath Ledger’s Joker—and is almost as great.)    If Casino Royale was all about Bond’s brute physical force, Skyfall is about his tactical canniness (I’m still not sure what Quantum of Solace was about; I think there was a boat chase at some point, right?). More than even Sean Connery, Daniel Craig captures the stalk and swagger and squareness of Fleming’s Bond. For a long while filmmakers seemed to mistake Bond’s steeliness for refinement, elegance. In fact, it’s a moral coldness. Bond is an orphan, after all; raised by The Service.   The last act of Skyfall does something that no other Bond film has done: it brings the character back to his roots. We see the home where he grew up. We get a broader sense of his lineage. And there, in the climactic battle, it’s not his personalized Walther PPK that Bond turns to. It’s his father’s old hunting rifle. And that seems to be the trajectory of the entire film. A return to the fundamentals. Bond, back to the basics.   As a result, Skyfall is the most satisfyingly contemporary James Bond movie—and also the one that seeks most earnestly (and most successfully) to associate itself with the very first films. Anyone familiar with the early Connery era will be thrilled by the final moments, when all the early set-ups fold perfectly together to establish a new status quo. By then, even the coat-rack in the corner of the room feels iconic. So, congratulations on a job well done, Mr. Skottowe.  Or shall I call you Q?  Sincerely,  Jared Young Status: Priority Post (5/5)"},{"title":"Nashville — Shownotes S01E05","url":"/2012/11/12/nashville-shownotes-s01e05","date":"2012-11-12 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Cast and Crew of Nashville, S1E05 – “Move It on Over” Episode synopsis:Rayna thinks about moving on when Deacon sets boundaries on their relationship; tension between Gunnar and Avery puts pressure on Scarlett; and as Juliette struggles with her mother’s addictions, Deacon is reminded of difficult moments in his past.

It looks like the, shall we say, “interesting” way that film turned out forced you to rethink your Hollywood career trajectory. Instead of rushing headlong into leading roles, it seems you dialed it back and looked for roles that were not only a good fit, but also provided the opportunity to work with some big name directors. Roles that required more than just your Mr. Universe credentials. First, and maybe due to your experience being overdubbed in Hercules, you took a very minor and speechless part in Robert Altman’s classic neo-noir The Long Goodbye. Sure, the uncredited role of “Hood in Augustine’s Office” probably didn’t turn any casting agent heads, but working with the hot, post-MASH, post-McCabe & Mrs. Miller Altman must have been its own reward. This was the 70s, after all, and directors were Hollywood’s new stars. If nothing else, it had to have been a master class on the new way to make films. After that, we come to Stay Hungry. Working with Bob Rafelson must have been a similar no-brainer. And you even got a speaking role to boot—the first in your own voice. Best known for the classic Five Easy Pieces, Rafelson was another director with a knack for showcasing actors in his decidedly character-driven stories.  Indeed, Stay Hungry operates almost as a Five Easy Pieces in reverse. Where Jack Nicholson’s Robert Dupea returns to his family’s wealthy estate after abandoning it for the blue collar world, Stay Hungry’s Jeff Bridges flees his business and societal obligations to become part of a new culture. Gym culture, to be precise. Your culture. Of course this is where you slide so naturally into the picture, and why it plays like such a smart career move on your part. No longer saddled with the terrible, ridiculous dialogue required of a Greek demi-god, you’re able to give a relaxed, and charismatic performance as Joe Santo — the Austrian-born, aspiring Mr. Universe (you still were at the career stage where your accent had to be explained). Along with the impressive body-building, though, Santo is also versed in literature, plays a mean fiddle, and is referred to as the curling champion of Austria. If you weren’t already aiming to be titled “Mr. Universe,” you would have had to settle for “Superman.” If only the rest of Stay Hungry had the same easy charm you provide as Santo. While it does boast a number of acutely-observed scenes and performances—Bridge’s and Sally Fields’ relationship comes immediately to mind—the film suffers from a schizophrenia, as it can’t decide whether it’s a character study or an exploitation film about body-building. But really, any film that climaxes by intercutting between you, wearing only a speedo, running to the rescue, and another 15 similarly dressed bodybuilders storming the streets and then holding an impromptu pose-off, can’t be all bad, can it? Just more bad than I wanted it to be.

Leos Carax has crafted a story that sidesteps logic at every turn to manufacture a transparent – but bizarrely absorbing – reality. We quickly abandon accusations of “well, that doesn’t make sense” and surrender ourselves to the simple conceit: someone, somewhere within the film, is orchestrating the actions of the main character. Who it is doesn’t really matter. Not when the circus is so engrossing. The mysterious puppeteer’s muse is played by Denis Lavant, a performance artist who is driven from one strange assignment to another. He goes by many names and many faces (enough to make even the actors in Cloud Atlas jealous), all in the service of a trying to create beauty in sex, violence, poverty, parenthood, or death. In the back of a limo, he prepares for each task with the silent dedication of an assassin. He treats the outside world as his stage, preferring to watch the passing landscape through a television feed rather than look directly out the window. His filtered reality is that strong—and it’s one of the most consistent strengths of the film. At one point, the performance artist observes that cameras used to be bigger than he was, then they shrunk to become the size of his head, and now they’re so small he can ‘t even see them. We can assume, therefore, that when he’s eating flowers, fingers, money, or hair (for example), someone is watching. Between getting shot and stabbed, he has quiet moments as a disappointed father and dying grandpa—even a few musical outbursts. This is a twisted tale that exists to be audacious. When he plays a naked Christ-figure in living tableau with the Virgin Mary (played by Eva Mendez), he does so with a full erection. Accepting the countless oddities that fill each frame is one thing, but the larger questions still remain. Does it all add up? Is the film more commentary than it is compelling? Do strong individual sequences (such as the acrobatic sexual acts in a green-screen room) say something about the nature of entertainment, or something about the characters themselves? The answers are as piecemeal as the film itself. The sequence with Kylie Minogue certainly does a lot to invest some much needed emotion to the mayhem—but it’s nearly undermined by a comically nonsensical final shot that literally brings to life the film’s title. Yet it all works. Somehow. And I’m not sure how you pulled that off. Maybe in the end, your job was just to make sure people weren’t sure exactly what’s going on – to keep us guessing. That would make perfect sense, after all.

Leo, you oversaw the recreation of history through beards and moustaches and follicular ornamentations, and your challenge was to do it without drawing so much attention to your work that it became a distraction. Lincoln could very easily have turned into the world’s longest Portlandia sketch. But it doesn’t. If I hadn’t looked at the cast list after the film, I wouldn’t have recognized half the actors who appear. Not entirely due to your handiwork, of course. Many of Lincoln’s cast members disappear into their roles. This is not a film populated by stars and performances; it’s populated by people. Those cast members include Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Jared Harris, James Spader, John Hawkes, Walton Goggins. In a film that focuses on the abolishment of slavery, you might forgive me for expecting a lot of award-baiting scenery-chewing. Fortunately, everyone makes choices that serve the film instead of their Oscar nomination clip. And then there’s Daniel Day-Lewis. I suppose at this stage in his career, I shouldn’t be surprised when he commits so fully to a role. Intellectually, I knew that he was hiding somewhere under the make-up and Lincoln beard, but I’ll be damned if saw him. Instead, I saw a man so fully realized that I was convinced the real Abraham Lincoln had to be like this.  Who else but this sly, humble, and, surprisingly funny character could trick a dysfunctional Congress into doing his bidding? Like the rest of the cast, Day-Lewis opts to go small—to play Lincoln not as a bombastic orator, but as a humble, self-educated backwoods lawyer unsure of his new environment. He likes to be the centre of attention, make no mistake of that—but this Lincoln would just as soon tell a dirty joke as give an inspirational speech. Now I know that the actors themselves didn’t dictate your team’s craft; that’s a top-down decision, one that comes from the director. You might find it strange that I’ve gone this far without mentioning Steven Spielberg. He’s kind of a big deal, so it’s only natural that he be front and centre in any discussion of Lincoln. Here’s the funny thing though: Spielberg doesn’t put himself  front and centre in the film. This is one of the most restrained films Spielberg has ever made. I’m sure the grand spectacle of the civil war must have held a huge allure for a director of such legendary visual aptitude, but, apart from some brief (and brutal) bookend sequences on the battlefront, Lincoln is an entirely engrossing  drama about process.. And even though Lincoln is filled with scenes of congressional grandstanding, not since E.T. has Spielberg used the silences between characters as effectively as he does here. In the few, quiet scenes we get between Lincoln and his youngest son Tad (Gulliver McGrath), Spielberg creates as rich a father-son bond as I’ve seen in recent years. Like Spielberg, you managed to avoid the pitfall of making the curled moustaches and chin-strap beards an amusing distraction (though Michael Stuhlbarg’s beard is as ridiculous as his character). Working with this top-tier cast and crew, you managed to turn a dry civics lesson (with an ending everyone already knows) into one of the best films of the year.

There’s plenty to love in this 23rd official installment of the series. The following, however, is a SPOILER-filled analysis of the final act to discuss why some of us at Dear Cast and Crew thought the ending didn’t work. 1. The film opens too big. Skyfall, like many Bond films, begins with a spectacular action sequence. This is important, not just to satisfy the demands of the franchise, but because it calibrates audience expectations. The director, Sam Mendes, is smart enough to establish important thematics as well as scale. The first shot tells us it’s a story about Bond being a few steps behind others and in the dark. We then learn, twice, that M is willing to sacrifice MI6 agents without hesitation to complete a mission. And as Bond suffers from a surely fatal gunshot wound, falls from a surely fatal height, and lands in a surely fatal rapid-filled river, we’re reminded that he may be mortal.  But each of these points end up being undermined by the end of the film. Not to mention, the rest of the film never lives up to these early action sequences. The film didn’t need more gadgets (even if a fingerprint-activated gun and same “gotchya!” moment was in Licence to Kill) or even a bigger set piece for the climax, but we do need to feel like more is at stake. 2. TMI! So much for being a “Secret” Agent. No other film franchise in history has the same successful track record as Bond. Not even close. Part of the appeal goes back the old narrative rule: the more we know about a character, the less interesting they become. The Bond brand, therefore, insisted their hero hide his true self behind martini preferences, non-stop adventures and a parade of beautiful women. We find out he was an orphan, raised by the Service, and always suspected he was a lonely soul trying to fake his way through a posh lifestyle. Except now Skyfall reveals that none of that is true. Bond was basically born at Downton Abbey. That tuxedo he wears is no longer a costume to hide the fact he’s simply a “blunt instrument” (as M points out in Casino Royale). He’s just reclaiming his rightful birthplace. This effectively kills the dashing, sexy, mysterious Bond in a way even guns, heights and rushing waters could not. 3. The film’s contradictory mission. The goal of Skyfall is to take the Bond character and franchise back to their roots. But in doing one, they end up betraying the other. Bond’s motivation to use his childhood home as the secret hideout, after it’s used to test him in an interrogation, seems to be an attempt to erase his own past. Of course in the process, he actually reveals that past to us. Worst of all, when the Skyfall manor is burning to the ground, Bond makes a point of saying how he “always hated this place, anyway”. If the location means nothing to him, why would it mean something to the audience? Or is he so cold and unsentimental that we should reconsider any love we have for him in the first place? There’s a rumour going around that Albert Finney’s role was intended for Sean Connery. Whether or not that’s true (such self-referential move may have been overly distracting), that decision would at least have instilled some relevance to Kincade the groundskeeper. Instead, it’s a thankless late entry by a character who barely moves the plot forward and is nonsensically spared by the villain, leaving him neither relevant nor poignant. Which is a big waste. His was the opportunity to provide a much-needed emotional punch to compensate for the scaled-down finale. Which leads us to: 4. Bond stole the show from M. Dame Judi Dench has been in as many Bond films as Sean Connery or Roger Moore. Skyfall had the perfect chance to give her a grand exit unlike anything we’ve seen in the Bond universe. First of all, the story does a great job of turning the crusty tactician M into this film’s true Bond girl. Unfortunately, Bond® Enterprises took this a bit too far (no, not with a sex sequence – but a boy can dream). When M has the chance to kill herself and Silva (Javier Bardem), it feels like the perfect end to her arc. She may have been willing to kill her own agents (including Bond) because she lives by a strict code, but she’ll die by it too. Then what happens? In the worst of all action movie clichés, the villain’s speech drags on too long and Bond kicks through the door to save the day. Not even a day – more like three minutes. M dies almost immediately from her previous wounds. She literally had her fate in her own hands, but was denied a poignant exit. Her last words to Bond might as well have been “Thanks for nothing, asshole.” Both characters are ultimately denied a special moment at the end. 5. Everything just goes back to normal. By the end of the film, we have a new M, a new Q, a new Miss Moneypenny and a fit-as-a-fiddle Bond. In fact, things are now more normal than they ever were before. It has actually returned us to the steady and predictable state of Bond affairs that Casino Royale was supposed to stand in such stark contrast to. For a film that wants to differentiate itself from the series, the last scene is about as standard as you get. Compare that to back when Bond was On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. The ending was bold and shocking: Bond gets married, and while driving away into a blissful new life, his bride (still in her wedding dress) was mowed down in a drive-by shooting. Happiness is definitively and infinitely out of his reach. Skyfall teases a similarly bleak ending with M’s death (also in Bond’s arms), but doesn’t have the guts to end it there.  Instead of leaving the audience hanging, we now know all to well what to expect the next go around.

Sweet bangs, skateboard skills, a laptop that could hack a bank machine, and his own personal cyborg assassin—he had it all. By the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, when (spoiler alert) you sacrifice yourself to destroy the computer chip inside your head that will give rise to sentient digital overlord SkyNet, it’s clear that you’ve become a proxy for young John Connor’s absent father, who, (double spoiler alert) you killed in the first film.  Throughout your career, that’s what you’ve been to me: a father figure. Even in movies like Predator, there’s a paternal spirit to the way you take control of your strike team when the flayed bodies begin to appear. In Commando, there’s not even a patriarchal analogy to untangle: you’re a father, maiming and murdering and cracking wise in search of your kidnapped daughter.  But the big surprise of Pumping Iron – the 1977 documentary that chronicles the regimens and routines of a group of bodybuilders as they train in preparation of the Mr. Olympia contest in Pretoria, South Africa – isn’t your youthful exuberance or frightening steroidal girth.  It’s that you’re the bad guy. More Thulsa Doom than you are Conan; more Bennett than John Matrix; more T-1000 than T-800. Like most films, Pumping Iron is fascinating to watch because it has a fascinating antagonist.  You have an irrepressible charisma—I don’t think anyone would argue otherwise. What other unintelligible man-mountain could get away, throughout his career, playing characters named Alan Schaeffer, Ben Richards, or Howard Langston (Schaeffer, Richards, and Langston: a great name for a 70s prog-rock band). Pumping Iron is the genesis of all that; the film that introduced the world to your gap-toothed smile, ovoid Austrian accent, and the ridiculous wingspan of your lats. When the film was released in 1977, you were no stranger to the big screen. Following in the footsteps of your mentor Reg Park, you starred as Hercules in a low-budget sword-and-sandals flick, and just the previous year played a version of yourself in Bob Rafaelson’s Stay Hungry. So, what was it about Pumping Iron that gave birth to the living legend known today as “Arnie” (aka. The Governator)? It’s simple, really. While the role of the hero might be more satisfying for the ego, the role of the villain is always more fun. The id, unleashed. And in Pumping Iron you seem to be having a lot of fun.  You hit all the beats of a great bad guy: the megalomaniacal visions (“I was always dreaming about very powerful people, dictators and things like that. I was just always impressed by people who could be remembered for hundreds of years, or even, like Jesus, be for thousands of years remembered.”), the merciless psychological warfare (to your opponents before the Mr. Olympia finals: “You make too much noise! Has to be very quiet in here, like in a Church!”), the cold-blooded backstory (telling your mother that you wouldn’t attend your father’s funeral: “I’m sorry, I can’t come. And I didn’t explain to her really the reasons why…I didn’t bother with it.”)  You even give us an expository rundown of your nefarious plans (“Franco [Columbu] is pretty smart, but Franco’s a child, and when it comes to the day of the contest, I am his father. He comes to me for advices. So it’s not that hard for me to give him the wrong advices.”).  But that’s not the only surprise in Pumping Iron. The hero of the film (and, yes, documentary films, by nature of the way they manipulate the truth through editing and music and every other filmic choice, have heroes and villains) is a young Brooklynite, born deaf, trained by his overbearing father in a dank local gym that looks like an abandoned Italian restaurant. His name is Louis Ferrigno. At twenty-two years-old, he’s the sweet, innocent, charmingly awkward foil to your arrogant Adonis. It’s hard not to cheer for him as he makes it his mission to unseat you as champion.  But it’s even harder not to cheer for you. Despite the profound hubris, the Machiavellian scheming, you’re the one we want to see onscreen. Whether as a golden god coasting through Gold’s Gym in Venice Beach or as a leather-jacketed cybernetic killing machine dedicated to protecting a foul-mouthed twelve year-old.   There’s a reason Lou Ferrigno didn’t go on to star in high-concept Ivan Reitman comedies and James Cameron blockbusters. And the reason is clear in the final moments of Pumping Iron. As the winner of the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest is about to be announced, it’s not the earnest, hard-working underdog we’re pulling for. We’re hoping the bad guy wins. And, for the next three decades, he will.   Sincerely,  Jared Young Status: Air Mail (4/5) "},{"title":"Rise of the Guardians","url":"/2012/11/21/rise-of-the-guardians","date":"2012-11-21 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Santa, It sure has been a while.

You’re Santa, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and the Sandman, the big four—of course you’ll have some tricks up your sleeve.

I feel like his skill set and modus operandi isn’t quite up to par with the rest of you. We do get to see the best of Jack – snow days, sledding, ice skating – but what about frostbite, figure-depriving snow suits, and flu season? I’m just saying, he isn’t a perfect choice. Maybe he’s just the type of conflicted character that makes for great story telling. In the end though, you believe in him, so I do too. But back to your mission: protecting the kids. Throughout your assignment there’s some laughter, some tears, and some seriously heavy questions asked. Where does Jack come from? Why is he here? And what happens if we all stop believing? Fortunately, Jack was able to answer the first two. Fortunately for us, we got a pretty good idea of the answer to the last one. Understanding the alternative, I consider your victory over Pitch Black to be a big win for the good guys.

Specifically, your history. I was curious how someone with a decidedly non-Romanian name gets not only a small role, but a co-writer credit on a Romanian film. And then I felt shame. You wrote Wild at Heart! And Lost Highway! I love David Lynch – I should know this! With that embarrassing hole in my cinematic knowledge filled in, the pieces quickly fell into place. Your involvement with the movie suddenly made a lot more sense: the road movie structure; the off-the-wall gangster characters; the maybe-they-are, maybe-they-aren’t dream sequences. Only one thing seemed to not fit; how did this become a romantic comedy? I’m guessing this is where director and co-writer Lucian Georgescu comes in. He must have thought it would help to lighten the mood by focusing on blossoming love. Well, if he did, he was wrong. It’s not so much that this aspect is bad—the slow and tentative relationship feels honest—it’s that when everything else comes in, the movie completely derails. Robert Traum (Marcel Lures, in a stiff performance, possibly due to his not-very-successful American accent) is an American professor who travels to Romania to research his Romanian Jewish rots and learn about the father he barely knew. There he meets Tanya (Mihaela Sirbu, relaxed and charming), a local historian who agrees to be his driver and guide. There’s your road movie. I suppose adding some light romance was a pretty simple graft. I could have seen this becoming one of those foreign movies that, as promised in 1990s-era Miramax trailers, “celebrates everything you love about life!” But there’s more. The couple’s search eventually leads them in pursuit of Sami, one of Robert’s father’s oldest friends. Sami travels the countryside in a caravan, showing movies in an ad-hoc theatre. He’s also pursued by gangsters. We are told he was kicked out of his town by a corrupt mayor who is fixing to replace Sami’s theatre with a shopping mall, even though his dilapidated town looks to have a population of 300. For some reason though, the mayor and his two gangster thugs still chase Sami through the countryside and remind him that no one likes the movies he shows. That’s about as threatening as they get. Once all these characters are introduced, The Phantom Father really doesn’t know what to focus on anymore. Is it about Robert’s relationship to his past? His interest in Tanya? Is it a caper about outsmarting the gangsters? Is Robert imagining all of this? These aren’t rhetorical questions. I’d like you to tell me because the film never answers them. Things got so muddy that by the end, I was wondering if large portions of what I saw were dream sequences. There is one for-sure sequence around the film’s midpoint that is clearly a dream, but refreshingly, didn’t end with a character waking up from sleep. That omission—along with an elliptical, disruptive editing style that I couldn’t find any rhyme or reason for—made me question the reality of anything that came after it, especially as things got more outlandish and possibly violent. (Yes, possibly more violent: a secondary, harmless character seems to meet an untimely, uncalled-for end. Off-camera. I think.) So yes, Barry, I’m throwing all of this back to you because, as the original source for this material, you must know where things came apart. Right? Maybe you can even describe it all to me, DVD commentary-style, as I watch the movie again. The same way a character in The Phantom Father, in a key moment, explains exactly what we’re seeing in an old silent film, instead of letting the images tell the story.

Someone obviously thought, hey if it worked for someone else, why create something original? It doesn’t even have to make sense anymore. In fact, it’s cooler if it doesn’t. Hmm. I wonder if there’s a parallel I can draw between this and the remake of Red Dawn… Forget it, that might require me to use my brain. Instead, let’s just talk just about what makes this movie implausible and awesome: the premise. Without any warning, foreign soldiers parachute into a small American town and unleash hell. A group of average teenagers escape into the hills and use guerilla tactics to fight off the invading army. U.S. solider Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) establishes his fighting credentials early and awkwardly, lest we forget later on. He then leads the rag-tag band of rebels called Wolverines through a series of coordinated assaults, no doubt inspired by his recent combat experience in Iraq. For someone who lives in Canada, I find this all utter fantasy and rather invigorating. I’m not interested or qualified to criticize the film’s unrealistic portrayals of violence or warfare. So I’m the target market. There were certainly moments in Red Dawn that hit the spot—namely, seeing all those parachutes fall from the sky, along with a few early attack sequences. I am, however, fairly well-versed in cinema. This is why my brain started putting out its own distress calls. Unconvincing performances! Lazy plot machinations! Incomprehensibly shot hand-to-hand combat sequences (and somehow a career stunt coordinator, Dan Bradley, directed this)! There’s also a strange failure to commit the film to a tone – is it supposed to be horrifying or glorifying? Is the reluctance to vilify the villains an attempt at being even-handed, or simply the fearful result of real-world retaliation? That might have been the case with China (see the not-so-subtle 2008 Olympic opening ceremonies), but extensive post-production efforts to change the enemy to North Korea rendered that threat more absurd. Which is also a big detriment to the film. The original Red Dawn (1984) tried to stir up American fears about the Soviets that had all-but disappeared by that point. Still, I’ll never forget the opening scene, with students dangling from a broken window after being mowed-down by machine-gun fire. The way the characters dealt with a fellow Wolverine who was bugged with a tracking device also left a sick feeling in my gut. That film is far from a masterpiece, but it helped me understand something about a guerilla war – it’s messy, grotesque, and makes people to unforgivable things. The new Red Dawn avoids ever going down that dark road. Instead, the film goes for big bangs and introduces a late McGuffin mission to undo the enemy’s advantage. Then the set pieces start to feel perfunctory and predictable, even if things aren’t tied up with a neat bow at the end (that just feels like sequel bait).  The big idea behind the film seems to capitalize on an exciting premise by just piling on more action.  So if you thought Rambo: First Blood II was an improvement over First Blood, then you’ll love the new Red Dawn. And if you’re a sucker for action like me, you might also find your emotions involuntarily drafted into certain moments. After all, it’s hard not to feel answer the call to battle.

Long time no see (since The Waterdance twenty years go, to be exact). To tell the truth, I thought our relationship was over. Not even the cow-flinging winds of an F-5 Twister were enough to bring you back to me (even as I hoped against hope with each repeated VHS viewing). Then you won an Oscar with that wet T-shirt, and I figured, well, this is As Good As it Gets. You had matured and moved on and I managed, with great difficulty, to forget you. Now, in The Sessions, you’ve come out of retirement guns-a-blazin’ with a performance that features Natasha Henstridge-levels of exposure.  But you’ve done so for a wonderful film that revels in the 90s (like me) and is the perfect vehicle to make your big comeback. Writer and Director Ben Lewin’s film is based on the true story of a man named Mark O’Brien (John Hawkes) who lives with an iron lung and is functionally paralyzed. His story was the subject of Breathing Lessons, the 1996 film by Jessica Yu that won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. The Sessions, however, makes the brave decision to focus only on the most titillating aspects of Mark’s life. At age 38, he solicits the blessing of his priest (William H. Macy) to hire the de-virgining services of a sex surrogate. This is where you come in. Both of you. Mark – and the movie – have sex on the brain. But the story rises well above lusty fantasies. The best parts are tender, touching, and revealing—and I’m not just talking about you. The film opens with a mix of archival news footage and Mark’s own poetry, which remarks upon his struggles, triumphs, and ambitions. But more than wanting to become a journalist, Mark longs for simple pleasures, like having someone wash his hairy nipples without suffering though an attendant’s sadistic “you-need-me-more-than-I-need-you” look. He longs for a gentle companion. Frankly, he longs for you. When Mark is hired to write a research paper on sex for the disabled, we get a montage that educates us about the pleasures of nipple licking, unorthodox sex positions, and how weed helps numb nerves in your mouth to perform better cunnilingus. There’s a lot early on to make you blush, but watching Mark squirm through these details (while his priest puts on a brave face) endears us to him all the more. Never more than when Mark explains how his penis speaks to him, but mainly through involuntary ejaculations as he’s being bathed. Helen Hunt is the polar opposite: controlled, calm, and commanding. She exposes you early and often as she performs body awareness exercises with Mark.  To his delight, she guides the back of his hand through breast etiquette: “If you touch one, you have to touch the other. It’s sort of a rule.” Lessons of this type are apparently what separate sex surrogates from prostitutes, although the film doesn’t split hairs. Besides being more introspective about her work (your work, really), she institutes a strict limit on the number of encounters, which becomes the film’s inherit drama. She’s less worried about overstaying her welcome than  about ”emotional transference”. Basically, building elaborate long-term fantasies about her (I wouldn’t know anything about that). You’ve done a great job, you two. I appreciate your bold decision to appear at this relatively late age, and I understand if we can never see each other again. Those are the rules, after all. But it was pretty great to break them—just this once.

Were the animals in Life of Pi real? Or were they simply the fabrications of talented storytelling? No, that can’t be true. How else can you explain your role on set?  Surely you had to struggle with real flesh-and-blood tigers, zebras, and orangutans. As the story unfolds, however, I’ll be damned if I could tell where reality ended and invention began. I just believed. That’s the beauty of Life of Pi. The titular Pi, aka Piscine Matel (Suraj Sharma), is a young man growing up in India who embraces a smorgasbord of religions and enjoys an even more eclectic collection of animals in his father’s zoo. But when times get tough and his family must move to Canada, they load their ark with animals before encountering a devastating storm.  This is where your job either became incredibly difficult or didn’t exist at all. Stranded on a life raft with a motley crew of mammals, Pi must find ways to survive. At the same time, we must accept what we are seeing. Yann Martel’s best-selling novel earned its label as “unfilmmable” as the story rights passed through the hands of many big directors before landing with Ang Lee. He fine tuned his ability to handle intimate performances in films like The Ice Storm, inspired awe with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and struggled with the perils of unconvincing effects on Hulk. All this training has lead to a beautiful adaptation that doesn’t tame the prose and poetry of the book – these elements are simply the inspiration for stunning and thought-provoking imagery. From the very first scenes, we’re treated to the most immersive 3D I’ve ever seen (yes, better than Avatar). The colourful compositions and steady pacing give the early India-based passages a calming comfort. By the time we hit the rough seas, that’s all swept away in a terrifying sequence that still manages to find unnatural beauty in a sinking ship.  From there, the story enters a realm of unapologetic fantasy that never feels false. Which is important, because the threat of an artificial Bengal tiger could easily disengage us. Lee never lets this threat break his ambitions. Large, surreal moments only serve to bring us deeper into the story. He seems as comfortable with that predator as you probably are. As a result, we get to enjoy a masterful director work at the top of his game. All the modern tools of the trade coalesce to tell a primal story about a boy and his struggle to understand life. And a few animals. Which, please tell me, were always real. They had to have been.

During my most impressionable years, you were the hero that loomed largest in my imagination. A diligently glued together Terminator 2 poster-sized puzzle hung proudly on my wall for years. Arnold-themed action figures, trading cards, and books filled my room while I excitedly worked my way through your back-catalogue of R-rated adventures. I never understood how my parents seemed to give any VHS tape with your face on it a free pass, even though so few of your films were suitable for a child. Maybe they somehow only saw The Villain, and forever associated you with harmless, over-the-top slapstick humour, and misguided attempts at bringing cartoon sensibilities to real-life. It’s very unlikely. Most people – and many fans – have never seen or even heard of this film. By the time your stardom hit my personal orbit, your authorized biographies gleefully started your career (and myth) with Conan the Barbarian. In fact, that’s what inspired the Early Arnold series on Dear Cast and Crew – my selfish desire to finally, truly, see all your films. I remember some early films being mentioned in those books without significant information or images, like Hercules in New York (which at least sounds macho and on-brand) and the documentary Pumping Iron. In the past weeks, I’ve learned why the first film is better remembered for its funny title, and why the latter is a cult classic and critical success. Stay Hungry was lost in the middle, even though it allowed you to play a laid-back version of yourself and co-starred both Jeff Bridges and Sally Fields. Then came The Villain. This film is the last time you could ever survive a huge flop or career misstep without any real consequence. After all, when Kirk Douglas – Spartacus himself! – is the lead, you had someone to hide behind. He plays Cactus Jack, a Wile E. Coyote-inspired villain trying to catch Charming Jones (Ann-Margaret). It’s a Western in look, but owes more to Looney Toons, where Jones’s tactics include dressing up as silly characters, pushing paper-mâché boulders down hills and painting a black hole in the side of a mountain (which Jones, of course, nonsensically rides right through). You play her companion on the journey, literally named Handsome Stranger. And at this point, you still were a stranger to most of America (not sure about the handsome part). The reasons the film doesn’t work are probably also why you seemed so uncomfortable every time the camera was pointed at you – nothing seems to fit. The sets are large and impressive, but never exploited for their full potential (the opening shots are worthy of a John Ford film). You have Oscar-nominated actors going through the motions of a serious film while taking whiskey shots through their eye balls. In fact, nothing can save the film’s lazy commitment to genre. I kept mirroring that pained look you have on your face every time you needed to be “act” without dialogue or in reaction to someone. The other actors all seem game to create a live-action Saturday morning cartoon, but Hal Needham’s direction is just too slow and lethargic (when he’s not speeding up the footage for ‘comedic’ effect). Even your own movements never feel natural in that super human body, constricted by a tight cowboy shirts and ten-gallon hat. You clearly do your best work in a Speedo or loincloth. Glad you figured that out sooner than later. None of these early films we’ve reviewed fit the one-note character mold that would define your phenomenal success and pave the way for your two terms as the Governor of California. But they do reveal another, more vulnerable and mistake-prone side to you that has come out in other ways over the past year. But now that’s it, there are officially no films left – at least until January 2013 when you attempt a career comeback with The Last Stand. So will I still passionately pursue your film career? Let me put it this way: When I was 8 years old and saw T-1000 stabbing a man through-a-milk-carton-through-the-mouth, I actually puked. But like a true Arnold-holic, I wiped my chin and came back for more. It only tested my resolve and pushed my personal limits. Seeing The Villain as a younger viewer might have helped me kick the habit of you but at this point, it’s too late. I’m in it for the long haul.

This adaptation of Leo Tolstoy ‘s massive book is filled to the brim with characters whose stories constantly intersect as they weave across all levels of 19-century Russian society in the twilight of an empire. The result is a wonderful, passionate, and cinematic approach to the one of the best literary works ever.  Atonement director Joe Wright uses every cinematic trick in the book to show what couldn’t be outright told. This film should be giving other directors new ideas on how unfilmable books might be treated. All of Tolstoy’s themes are included – the effects of class, gender, tradition, loyalty, compassion, forgiveness, hatred, love, lust, as well as the contrasts between agrarian and city life. The trick is to not only rely on dialogue and acting, but also lighting, judicious editing, fantastical set design, sharp cinematography, dancing, and a sometimes-impressionistic approach to reality.  The story follows Anna (Keira Knightley) who becomes involved with the charismatic young Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). She then abandons her fastidious older husband (Jude Law) an all hell breaks loose. Diverting from this titular tale is the story of Levin (Domhnall Gleeson) who is trying both understand his role in the world, and win the heart of Kitty (Alicia Vikander). Their romance is complicated by the fact that Kitty is betrayed and embarrassed by both Anna and Vronsky’s affair.  Note that this is an extremely simplistic summary of the film’s plot (to say nothing of the novel). Most reviews are fixated on how much was left out. Sheesh! Naturally there were going to have to be choices. At only two hours, this had to be a stripped-down interpretation of the work. If we were using the adaptation math of Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit, Anna Karenina would have to have been about nine movies long.  I think Tolstoy would have approved. There are certainly compromises, a different cast might have brought entire different sensibilities to the story. You could even make a few more movies with all uncredited material. But this version is loyal to Tolstoy, whose work was epic and passionate but often built of small moments. Glances, quiet conversations, and introspection are just as important as religious or sexual ecstasy and bellowed curses. It’s all in there, and the complexities of being human are woven throughout, from the doomed leading lady to the most innocuous Ballroom Guest. Thank you, sir.

Strina, Business and Legal Affairs  As you probably know, Adam Smith, the father of modern economic theory,  coined term “the invisible hand” 250 years ago to describe the supposed self-regulating nature of the marketplace. This laissez-faire philosophy became the maxim of many American capitalists who fought any effort to criminalize their profits. But then, as the Keynsians predicted, gambling with other people’s money resulted in a devastating economic collapse. And so the crooked brokers trusted their recovery to the very real hands of Brad Pitt and his 12-gauge stimulus plan.  Or so the story goes. Am I reaching for this metaphor? I’m probably not reaching far enough. The socio-economic commentary in Andrew Dominik’s Killing Them Softly is about as subtle as a shotgun blast to the face. Warranted, perhaps, since that’s also Jackie Cogan’s (Brad Pitt) method of choice when administering street justice. In particular, he’s looking for a couple of hapless crooks that rob a big-money poker game between mob bosses. Finding the triggermen isn’t hard, but he needs to make a decision: should he simply make an example of these weasels, or give them a free pass in exchange for rooting out the brains behind the operation? Let’s just say that for the story’s sake, he opts for the past of most resistance. From a pure business sense (and despite being a faithful adaptation of George V. Higgins’ source material), this is a straightforward gangster picture that traffics in Quentin Tarantino territory. As the criminal middlemen haggle over prices and chitchat about Obama’s latest speech, Dominik makes no small effort to place his characters squarely at the centre of contemporary America. And while Brad Pitt is certainly the star, the real breakout performance comes from Scoot McNairy. Pressured to rat out his employers, McNairy’s strangely childish vocal affectations make him sound like a sympathetic incarnation of Adam Sandler who’s in way over his head.  Ray Liotta’s character also earns a lot of our empathy, but mainly by being a punching bag of bad luck with a sinking stock value. Like John Hillcoat’s Lawless, which came out earlier this year, Domink’s third film (after Chopper and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford), comes with some lofty expectations. While Hillcoat’s latest effort ended up feeling bland, Domink’s approach (from the central metaphor to the visuals) is overly blunt. On one hand, the opening minute is absolutely jarring, bold and lays the path for a substantive creative statement. But later, clichéd uses of hyper slow-motion feel motivated more by profit (and looking great in a trailer), than any substantive storytelling purpose. In these instances, the direction is heavy handed when the same conclusion could have been reached with invisible control. But hey, it’s a free country. I got something from this film, and that’s all that matters. Right?

Echinacea? Gene supplements? Cryogenic freezing? It’s not that I find it amazing that you’ve lived to the ripe old age 103; no, Chinese peasants and Indian yogis do it all the time. What I find amazing is that you’ve maintained your artistic faculties to this late stage, and – perhaps more amazingly – are using them to pose questions about the very act of filmmaking that, after more than eight decades behind the camera, you’re still engaged in. There’s a distinct timelessness to your 2010 film The Strange Case of Angelica. And I suspect it’s more than just the usual encroachment of Europe’s hefty cultural history. It’s impossible to tell, in the opening few scenes, what year the film takes places in. Only later, as we follow a sleek modern sedan cruising through the streets of a contemporary Portuguese city, is it clear we are rooted in the present. But only sort of. Right, Manny?  Anachronisms reign throughout; Isaac – a Jewish photographer who is summoned to the estate of a wealthy family to take a portrait of their recently deceased daughter – uses a 60s-era Leica, and his studio is decidedly analog: a lot of plastic bins filled with chemicals, developing proofs clothes-pinned to hanging wires. Ancient funerary customs are observed, yet references are made to the current European economic crisis and the study of antimatter.   And still, this film feels a half-century old. At least.  Why? The camera is heavy, rooted to the ground. With very few exceptions, it never tilts; never pans; never tracks. You’ve cut this story together from a series of carefully composed static shots. This aesthetic is reflected tonally. Your dialogue is straightforward; your plotting is linear. Some elements suffer this approach (Isaac’s relationship with his wisecracking lady landlord feels like something from a bad sitcom). Others, however, are buoyed by it. In the middle act, you conjure a strange dream sequence that might seem absurd except for how perfectly it represents the ideas at the heart of your film: the tension between new and old.  Funny how one might watch this and, not knowing the filmmaker is a centenarian, accuse the auteur of not knowing enough about film theory. But it’s the opposite of that, isn’t it? It’s not a lack that we see onscreen; rather a stripping-down to the essentials. In fact, one of Isaac’s fellow lodgers uses an apt filmic metaphor in that discussion about the duality of matter and antimatter: “No big special effects, like on a Hollywood movie.” I guess, then, your advice about defying the laws of aging is right there in the film: the old is the fundament upon which everything new is built.  When Isaac gazes out of his window, one afternoon, and spies a group of laborers working in the vineyards on the other side of the river, his landlady asks him why he’s so interested in watching them “work the old-fashioned way.”  Isaac tells her: “Old-fashioned work interests me.”  She counterpoints: “They’re the only ones who do it the old way. Now we use machines.” Yes, everyone else is obsessed with the machinery, but you, Manoel— you’re doing it the old way. Bravo!

Ironic, isn’t it?  A film that’s all about you, and one that you clearly wanted nothing to do with, is also dedicating itself to you posthumously.  I’m sure the filmmakers’ intentions were pure.

In fact, after shunning Hollywood and the media for so long, I would have almost been insulted if you broke your self-imposed exile for this film. But now you’re gone for good, and this stalker-doc about you may be the best we get. You can’t blame them or anyone else for being curious about your personal story. After essentially writing the book on how to make a teen movie, you packed up to Chicago and seemed to disappear. Your filmmaking resumé, which includes The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, is the envy of a generation. Your talent as a writer seemed unstoppable, penning classics from Christmas Vacation to Home Alone. But one day, somehow, you simply had enough. Not necessarily of the work itself (as you continued to write successful family films under the pseudonym Edmond Dantès), but obviously with the people, the business and the attention. That of course, didn’t stop a van full of Canucks from trying to get some face time with you. This film was made with the aspirations of Roger and Me, but the results don’t pass the low of Where in the World is Osama bin Laden? And it’s not just your absence that hurts the final product (see a great documentary like Kubrick: A Life in Pictures for proof that one can succeed without its subject’s involvement). Only secondary actors that appeared in your films make it into this picture. Each actor probably felt shanghaied at the time, evidenced by the poorly lit, poorly recorded handicam quality of the interviews. Still, these moments are the only lifeblood in the film (especially a heartfelt moment by Judd Nelson). A few Hollywood directors you influenced also give their commentary on your work, notably the always-on Kevin Smith and Juno director Jason Reitman. But they never knew you, and so their inclusion adds no real substance. Worst of all, the film stops dead whenever the journey to find you it is featured. Crossing the border from Canada to the U.S., for example, is a painfully inauthentic dramatic moment. Constant ramblings by those on the journey about your films also simply feel like filler to stretch the runtime into a feature film. Forget about your stance against doing media interviews, your sensibilities as a filmmaker alone would have been enough reason to avoid this story.

You’ve earned your moment in the spotlight. True, your success (like most professions within the film industry) is usually measured by how little you stand out in the storytelling process. But every few decades, make-up artists hit a new milestone that forces the general public to take notice. I have every confidence that 2012 belongs among those banner years. We’ve seen incredible achievements (Looper), awkward failures (Prometheus) and raging controversies (Cloud Atlas). But most important, we’ve seen a compelling argument for why, at a time when photo-realistic digital technologies threaten to make your job obsolete, prosthetics still have a vital place in cinema. Part 1: Making-up History Scene from The Artist (2011)Even before cinema, make-up has served two important functions: to be corrective (covering flaws and emphasizing attractive features) and creative (building imaginative new characters on actors). Silent film actors would often apply their own pancake make-up when high contrast orthochromatic film was used. But as new panchromatic stocks allowed cinematographers to differentiate the entire light spectrum as subtle shades of gray on black and white film, the task quickly fell on specialists like yourselves to evolve the trade for the medium.  Lon Chaney Sr. - Hollywood’s first famous make-up artistLon Chaney Sr. was the first to turn his own face into a shocking work of art for filmgoers. His renditions of Quasimodo for The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and the unmasked man in The Phantom of the Opera (1931) preserved the character’s humanity behind the plaster with legendary results. Jack Pierce followed suit with Frankenstein (1931), and became an inventive pioneer in the trade, relying on scientific and surgical techniques to mold rubber latex into the everlasting images from The Wizard of Oz (1939), Dracula (1931), and a treasure chest of monsters for Universal Studios. Chaney and Pierce’s fierce rivalry would push them through many innovations and come to define the medium for a generation. But household names were hard to come by when most make-up artists didn’t even receive a screen credit for their work. Maurice Seiderman, for example, was simply an unqualified but ambitious hair sweeper for RKO when he insisted he could turn a 25-year-old Orson Wells into a decrepit 70-year-old using elastics to trigger muscle reactions. He won the job and still wins acclaim for his work 70 years later, even if you won’t see his name listed on the film itself. Only when unmistakable examples of excellence presented themselves, as they did in the 1960s, did the Academy Awards create special honorary Oscars for William Tuttle’s transformations for The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao (1964) and John Chambers’ advances for Planet of the Apes (1968). But it would take the unfathomable snub of ignoring Christopher Tucker’s spellbinding work on The Elephant Man (1980), created from real-life casts of John Merrick’s body, to push your profession into its own regular category for the Academy Awards. Fittingly, the first recipient of the annual prize would go to Rick Baker the very next year for his incredible designs on An American Werewolf in London (1981). Baker has gone on to be a perennial contender for the prize, winning seven Oscars and getting his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame just this year. Rick Baker (left) with American Werewolf in London director John Landis And yet, the 1980s are often heralded as the last great gasp of make-up effects before the incredible advances of computer generated images (CGI). Just as the profession had to reinvent itself with the advent of new film stocks and colour pictures, high-definition televisions and motion capture technology have created the need for more innovations, which in 2012 have been answered in subtle and stunning ways.

Most importantly, the make-up must elicit the desired outcome in the audience, be it horror, beauty, or anything in between. When the effect fails, the film’s effectiveness usually follows. Films exploit your craft to varying degrees. When the actor is completely disguised and evolves into another being altogether (like the Orcs in The Hobbit), the result is closer to a mask. The make-up artist’s task in this case is much different than trying to preserve, enhance, or age a person’s unique features. In 2012, special attention seems to have been paid towards the latter end of the spectrum. What follows is a brief description of how some of this year’s films have contributed to the evolution of the trade.Rick Baker, make-up artist for Men in Black 3 (2012) Although there is some overlap, I’ve divided make-up techniques that require us to recognize and empathize with the original actor into the four main subsets – verisimilitude, aging, style and morphing. Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock (2012)Verisimilitude – Every year, Oscar-bait roles are dangled to audiences in the form of the bio-picture. Great casting goes a long way for making a known actor look like another known person, but it’s the plaster casting that often seals the deal. In recent years, Charlize Theron, Jaimie Foxx and Meryl Streep have all taken home statues for allowing the audience forget the line between them and the famous/infamous person they portray. But of course, their performance is enabled by near flawless work on your part. Now Daniel Day Lewis seems to completely embody Lincoln (2012), Sir Anthony Hopkins is being heaped with praise for becoming cinema’s very own Hitchcock (2012) and even Julianne Moore and Ed Harris had no shortage of genuine gotchya moments by disappearing into the once ubiquitous politicians Sarah Palin and John McCain in HBO’s Game Change (2012). Their performances rightly deserve credit, but it’s the subtle touches to a nose, a brow or a chin you apply that allow us to truly pull off the illusion. Make-up artistry continues to impress, and will be an important actor’s ally for years to come.  Prometheus (2012)Aging – Film critic Gene Siskel used to describe old-age make-up as the art of making young actors look like a turtle. Behold, Guy Pierce in Prometheus (2012). Seeing ol’ wrinkled-sskin doesn’t just kill the audiences’ “wow!” double take that Seiderman inspired for an aged Citizen Kane (1941). This big budget film is a first rate offender because of the director himself, Ridley Scott, who never uses Pierce at his natural age and simply steals a paycheck from any of our fine octogenarian actors. Yes, the ultra-rich zillionaire character is supposed to be unnaturally prolonging his life, but that’s no excuse for taking the audience out of the film. The moment we see the make-up, our disbelief can no longer be properly suspended. We know it’s possible – I was amazed by how much the Sally Field of today in Lincoln (2012) looks like the aged Sally Field in Forrest Gump (1994). Unfortunately in this respect, the aging make-up of 2012 was not one for the ages. The Hunger Games (2012)Style – I have to assume that make-up artists never have more fun than when they are playing by their own rules. Splitting Natalie Portman’s personalities in the Black Swan or forcing The Dark Knight to face his darker half in The Joker are recent examples of a make-up artist’s chance to put a personal signature on a piece. This year, examples of war paint has been used in the subtle service of effeminate mob busters Lawless (2012), twisted television personalities in The Hunger Games (2012) and bold new takes on fantasies like Snow White and the Huntsman (2012) or John Carter (2012). But keeping it simple also worked wonders, from the chilling effect of white powdered walking spirits in War Witch (2012) to the campy delights of Dark Shadows (2012) to preserving the perfect payoff in 21 Jump Street (2012). Meanwhile, Rick Baker continued to show the world why your work still matters by beautifully blending aliens with the visual effects in Men in Black III (2012) and the team behind The Cabin in the Woods (2012) took inspiration from every horror film of the past three decades to create their creatures. Even some abominable film entries had their best work done by make-up artists, such as the brain-faced nurses in Silent Hill: Revelation (2012). With so many sequels, prequels, reboots, mash-ups and remakes, 2012 didn’t provide as many opportunities for flare as you might have liked, but at least you didn’t let us down. In fact, you helped us finally look forward. Looper (2012)Morphing – The future of make-up is here, in a process I’ll call “morphing”. One perfect example is Looper (2012), where instead of banking on Joseph Gordon Levitt’s face to sell the film, the strategy is to create a new character that is meant to evoke a young Bruce Willis. It was a high-risk gamble with unknowable returns, but most people agree the effort paid off. Much more controversial was the work in Cloud Atlas (2012), where over a dozen actors transform into new characters that span centuries. The battle to render the actor invisible, in this case, was not the ultimate goal. So while many audiences were reasonably distracted by playing connect-the-dots between actors and characters, the film was not trying to hide your work. For better or worse, recognizing who is underneath the make-up  was actually important to the audience’s interpretation of the film. The critically acclaimed French arthouse film Holy Motors (2012) took the same approach to character morphing, giving the trend another important success in 2012 over the usual low-brow comedic treatment the effect usually gets in the faces of Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy. Holy Motors (2012)Needless to say, the art of make-up has come a long way and has branched off into incredibly inspiring ways of enhancing storytelling. The praise you get is just far too patchy. As far as I’m concerned, you can tell Mr. DeMille you’re ready for your close-up.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey’s use of high frame-rate photography—capturing images at 48 frames per second rather than the traditional 24—has generated almost as much pre-release buzz as Peter Jackson’s return to Middle Earth itself. So, let’s just address that up front: how does it look? Not very good, I’m afraid. While it’s true that the higher rate offers a stunning sharpness and clarity, it doesn’t look very much like a movie. In fact, it looks a lot like video—video from 30 years ago. The combination of higher frames and 3D seems to have had the opposite effect Jackson intended: characters feel separated from the background, even when they’re being shot on a real set; images appear overly bright in a way that recalls BBC theatre productions of the late 70s. The result is maddeningly distracting. Even though Jackson and his crew are using the same awesome New Zealand landscapes and locations as they did in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, I couldn’t get lost in them like I did with those films. But this letter isn’t supposed to be about frame rates and new technologies. I don’t begrudge Jackson his desire to push cinema in new directions. It’s entirely possible that ten years from now we’ll look back on The Hobbit in the same way as The Jazz Singer: as an important (if flawed) foray into a new era of cinematic storytelling. And maybe we’ll have a chuckle at all of our overwrought hand-wringing. No, this letter is written out of concern for you, Andy, and your position as Apprentice Editor. I fear you may not be learning the essentials of your chosen trade. It’s not called “the invisible art” for nothing: an editor is tasked with trimming a film down to its essentials, making a piece cohesive both tonally and narratively—and doing it all in a manner that is completely transparent. That doesn’t necessarily mean a good editor makes a short film. None of the films in the Rings trilogy can be accused of efficiency—but that’s okay, because their expanded running times open them up and create a world that feels like it has existed for millennia, providing a very specific context for the epic adventure. In fact, the DVD extended cuts of the trilogy further proved this, as they tended to feel more coherent and better paced than their truncated theatrical siblings. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, though, suffers from the opposite problem. It feels like as if it has been edited not to tell the best story possible, but to match a predetermined running time.  A running time the original novel’s slight story just cannot support. Where The Fellowship of the Ring had a prologue that sets up the arc of all three films, here we are given two prologues—one detailing the rise and fall of Middle Earth’s last great Dwarven kingdom, and one that reintroduces Bilbo and Frodo Baggins (which exists primarily to transfer the audience’s goodwill from the original trilogy). The next hour then introduces a younger Bilbo (Martin Freeman, properly flustered), Gandalf (Ian McKellan, charming and commanding as ever) and the 13 Dwarves (each given his own individual introduction) that enlist Bilbo on their quest to win back their kingdom from the dragon Smaug. Everything – from the overlong dinner sequence to the two (yes, two!) unending songs – feels like a sort of filmic stall tactic. Where some complained that The Return of the King was the film that refused to end, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the film that refuses to start. This approach infects most of the film. Action scenes are dragged out until their relevance to the story is forgotten. Characters are introduced haphazardly in scenes that last too long and have only the most tangential relationship to the main plot. The tone is wildly uneven as the lighter Tolkien story collides with the self-serious epic tones that I suppose are meant to make this more of a piece with the grandiosity of Lord of the Rings. It never really comes together. Of course, you may be in a better position to know if this will play out over the new trilogy’s nearly 9-hour running time. Being the first part of three, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey may suffer for lack of revealing the grand plan Jackson has envisioned. Here’s hoping. But I don’t think that’s what’s keeping The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey from working on its own terms. There are great moments that come directly from the novel that work marvellously because they have been very clearly directed and, yes, edited for maximum storytelling impact. The battle of the stone giants is short but awe-inspiring. An encounter with three cave trolls finds the right balance of humour and menace. And, finally, there is the famous game of riddles between Bilbo and Gollum (Andy Serkis, perfect again). A scene that take sup 30 pages of Tolkien’s book has been worked into a tight, tense 10 minutes that is the highlight of the entire film, proving that a mastery of the fundamentals of filmmaking can overcome the highest of frame rates. When you look back at your apprenticeship, these are the scenes that you should study. Wow, this letter is close to three times the length of what we usually write here. Maybe The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey inspired me more than I realized.

Yup, our Early Arnold series is over, but how could I resist this important oversight in your oeuvre? Christmas in Connecticut (1992) is not some embarrassing got-to-get-paid mistake from your pre-Conan the Barbarian days. You’re the muscle behind this made-for-TV mess that came out at the peak of your prime. The question is why? WHY? I’m guessing the answer begins and ends with your unparalleled ambition. That’s why imagining your stilted direction behind every scene gave me a perverse pleasure, like watching the Christmas equivalent of Tommy Wiseau’s The Room. The first time I felt your hand was during the hilariously inept mountainside rescue by Jefferson Jones (Kris Kristofferson) that kicks off the story. He digs a kid up from the snow, drops him a few times, and stumbles through one of the fakest storms I’ve ever had the pleasure of laughing through.  “Dats great, yah! More esspresion! Show da snow you a man!,” I pictured you saying. From there, the world’s most clichéd producer (Tony Curtis) ropes Jeffereson into a Christmas special with fraudulent cooking show host Elizabeth Blane (Dyan Cannon). A mixture of zany antics and adultery follow, both of which you’re all too familiar with. There’s no point in analyzing things too closely, though—you obviously didn’t. As the biggest movie star in the world, failure must have seemed completely out of your reach. Or did it?  It’s no doubt a calculated choice to remake a 1940s semi-classic in the relatively safe confines of a Christmas TV special. But unlike the characters you play, who never miss a shot, shooting a scene as the director is not nearly so easy.  I’m sure you felt confident though, having worked with top talent from the time: James Cameron (twice!), Paul Verhoeven, John McTiernan, and even two comedies with Ivan Reitman. None of that seems to matter though, since your only inspiration seems to be that dorky film you made before breaking into the big-time, The Villain. From the half-hearted humour to the wildly inconsistent performances, it’s no surprise this film isn’t part of the annual holiday season TV rotation.  It might, however, have a chance at being a midnight movie classic if we organize a call-and-response crowd participation version. Imagine: theaters full of people screaming out your presumed direction in Austrian accents. This could be the catalyst for the comeback you’re looking for. We can start with the Mayfair Theatre in Ottawa – what do you say?

He took pleasure in punishing his fair-haired muses in a series of thrillers that established him as one of the most important directors of all time. Vertigo (1958) is the classic case study, as it elegantly reveals both the auteur’s obsession and his mastery of the medium (despite being a financial flop, it was recently ranked the #1 film of all-time by the highly influential Sight and Sound poll). But the public will always know him best for Psycho (1960), and in the cheeky new biopic Hitchcock, director Sacha Gervasi proposes that ol’ “Hitch” was even more consumed by his material than we presumed. The story begins in 1944 on the farm of Ed Gein, the killer who would inspire the character of Norman Bates in Psycho, along with countless other movie villains. Believing this grizzly tale could be more than just a schlocky B-movie in his hands, Hitchcock went against the studio (and common sense) to finance Psycho on his own. Of course, that’s not entirely true; he depended, as well, on the support and creative abilities of his wife Alma Reville (Helen Mirren), whose devotion was overshadowed by the leading ladies Hitch fawned over. The main blonde here is Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson), playing the role that would make her cinema’s original scream queen (years before her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis would inherit the title). To the film’s credit, Hitchcock never tries to parallel the story of Psycho . Rather, it elicits a playful tension throughout by mimicking certain of Hitchcock’s most famous films (most frequently Rear Window). Peepholes into the girls’ changerooms and lewd commentary during takes to “inspire” his actresses help paint the picture of an artist who longed to experience the thrills of his own films. Emma, your only scene as the Blonde Fan, after the premiere of North by Northwest, lingers just uncomfortably long enough to set the stage for what’s to come. But that’s only the start. Between imaginary conversations with Ed Geins to the psychoanalysis of his actors to make sure they can live their parts, Hitchcock does a great job of indulging our own desires to expose the man behind the legend. It’s an unapologetically fun film, even with its disturbing undertones (much like Hitchcock’s own work). Re-imagining the making of a Hitchcock horror classic is à la mode this year, after The Girl went behind-the-scenes of The Birds (poor Toby Jones— he plays Truman Capote the same year as Philip Seymour Hoffman, and now has Anthony Hopkins to contend with in his portrayal of the Master of Suspense). I guess we just can’t get enough of this sort of nostalgic pop-culture voyeurism. Neither could Hitch. Tell me, Emma: what would the real Hitchock have discovered if he got to know you?  You’re clearly not just a pretty face, having worked in the make-up department for The Black Swan, Rise of the Planet of the Apes and… Piranha 3DD. Yup, he would have loved you too.

In the years that preceded it, there were two films that my friends and I watched obsessively and adapted into a form of shorthand, building from every memorized quote and reference and impression a Nell-like language that was probably indecipherable to our terrified parents. Those two films were Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Dumb & Dumber. In the summer of 1996, we lined up on opening night to see Jim Carrey’s much-hyped follow-up in hopes of adding to our glossary. But this letter isn’t about the awkward silence that followed us home from the theater after we saw The Cable Guy for the first time. This letter is about you.  What I took home with me from that enigmatic, unquotable two hours was a crush on the sweet girl who played Matthew Broderick’s reluctant fiancée. Petite blondes with squeaky voices were a staple of the mid-90s (No Doubt’s “Tragic Kingdom” came out the previous year, Chasing Amy would come out the next) and I fell in love with you in the innocent, perverted way that sixteen year-old boys do (it’s all fantasies built from half-understood articles in Cosmopolitan and the graphic stories from Penthouse Letters). Is it weird to tell you that we’ve shared a lot of romantic dinners, walks on the beach, impromptu ice cream dates, island getaways? And, you know—done other stuff? (*change of subject*) It’s funny how distorted your sense of age is when you’re sixteen. Whereas a seventeen year-old girl seemed so far beyond my mortal reach that I didn’t dare cast her in my amorous daydreams, a woman in her mid-twenties seemed completely tangible, completely attainable. That we might end up together felt far more plausible than catching the attention of any girl a grade ahead of me. And now you’re forty. And the stress and strife and joy of those intervening decades is fuelling your performance in This is 40, your real-life husband’s sort-of-but-not-really sequel to Knocked Up. It’s one of those effortless performances that unfolds with such guileless control that it’s difficult to accurately measure just how good it is.   It was probably a mistake to begin my letter with all that fawning. Because it’s going to make what I’m about to say seem completely baseless, like I’m resurrecting a teenage crush in some awkward, transparent attempt to win your favor (that’s only, like, 40-percent of my motivation). But I’m going to say it anyway: your performance in this movie should be nominated for an Oscar®.  Sure, everyone loves it when Meryl Streep wears prosthetic teeth and puts on a billowy accent, and, yes, it’s terrific when Helen Mirren gives us that glassy glare from beneath the brim of a big floppy hat, and, no, I would never disparage Kate Winslet’s unique ability to marry sexiness and severity in service of illuminating the horrific emotional aftermath of the holocaust—but there must be room, in the midst of all that crushing melancholy and self-seriousness, for a performance as poignant and carefree and honest as the one you give in this film.  In the course of This is 40, your character, approaching her 40th birthday and convinced that it’s symbolic of some great (but ineffable) life-change, cruises through a British Parliamentary session’s-worth of invective and name-calling, deals with enough interfamily drama to fill the pages of a Tolstoyan epic, and restrains enough despair to fuel a Panzer tank rolling into snowy Warsaw. The result is something so tonally perfect and nuanced that it almost transcends criticism; how do you judge someone for being a real human being?  Your husband Judd has made your mid-life crisis the engine the drives the plot, and that’s irrefutable proof that you’re his muse (by the very dictionary definition of the word: n. the goddess or power regarded as inspiring a poet, artist, or thinker). Instead of making your onscreen husband Paul Rudd – clearly his cipher – the center of the narrative, he has structured the movie around you. And throughout he gives you some of the best scenes, like the one in which, with the method-style bombast you might expect from a young Pacino, you unleash a torrent of verbal abuse on a bucktoothed thirteen year-old who has been harassing your daughter online. Or the scene where (spoiler) you’re informed of a surprise pregnancy, and, with only your eyes, suggest a progressions through all five stages of grief in single ten-second stretch. It’s a shame that the Academy has never had the acumen to recognize how special something like that is.  A film like This is 40 is always the sum of its parts: individual scenes, individual gags, individual comedic beats. But here, knitting it all together, is your masterpiece. I’m not sixteen anymore, and not so easily won over by simple cuteness and charm—but my crush has nonetheless been rekindled.  But there’s really only one thing I want you to take away from this letter: If for some reason it doesn’t work out with you and Judd, you can totally call me. Just to talk or whatever. I’m a good listener. Maybe we could go out for ice cream. Or get away to a remote island. Or other stuff. Whatever.

How else would someone like you, who diligently lists off the hard work of others, ever get any recognition of your own? When the credits for The Guilt Trip rolled, your name was nowhere to be seen – even though you were directly responsible for getting all those names out there. You’re not alone. Mothers, too, know a little something about being ironically overlooked. So it’s nice to see a film acknowledge the pains and joys of this type of selfless, unacknowledged devotion. And even more rare to do so without ever nagging the audience. Director Anne Fletcher is the steady hand behind the wheel of this family bonding road trip. When young entrepreneur Andrew Brewster (Seth Rogan) learns about his mother’s first love before driving cross-country for his business, he invites her to come along for the ride with the hidden goal of meeting the man he was named after. Barbra Streisand hits a comedic homerun as Joyce Brewster, striking an impressive balance of capturing the overbearing concerns of a mother without ever descending into parody. For his part, Rogan dials back his typically foul-mouthed antics and presents a son that’s not exactly ungrateful or spoiled, but afraid to confront his faults. This is a safe film. It’s a nice film. It’s the kind of film I wish I would have seen with my mom (I never know what’s safe to see together after suffering through that otherwise fantastic lesbian scene in Chloe). And while The Guilt Trip doesn’t deserve to the level of praise a mother may bestow upon her only son, it shouldn’t be dismissed like someone who has to hear those same praises either. The film is a gentle ride without any twists and turns that usually come with this type of trip. What the story loses by being a little quaint, it usually makes up for by feeling genuine. Also, by focusing on the core mother-son relationship, and keeping any secondary characters at arms length, we get time to fully enjoy Streisand’s unique brand of humour. She alone is worth the trip to the theatre. You probably don’t do your job for the praise, but if the film teaches us anything, it’s that everyone needs a little boost now and then. So good job, and let’s all make a bigger effort to not overlook the often thankless roles out there.

This choice, being a Tom Cruise production staring Tom Cruise, was probably never yours to begin with. But really, does it matter if a character who, as described in Lee Child’s novels, stands 6’5” tall and weighs 250 pounds is played by an actor known for being, well,  the opposite of that? No, not if the movie is good. Then the decision can stand on is own merits and cries of miscasting will fade into the distance. Unfortunately Jack Reacher is not good. But—twist!—it’s not because of Cruise. He may not have the size necessary to intimidate with presence alone, but as an emotionless dialogue delivery device, he’s fine. Jack Reacher is awesome at everything he does. In fine Cruise fashion, he continually tells other characters exactly what he is going to do and then we watch him do it. Exactly like he said. He’s a built-in spoiler for his own movie. That can work to a certain level when all Cruise is asked to do is be awesome at flying F-15s or scaling the Burj Khalifa, but not so well when he’s imposing his own brutal version of justice on others. Actually, it’s kind of repugnant. Reacher, a man living off the grid (after all, how could one so righteous associate himself with the rest of us sheep?) is called in to help find the truth in what seems to be an airtight case: James Barr, an ex-Marine sniper has shot 5 seemingly random people in Pittsburgh. The cops have found, to quote a good Cruise movie (Minority Report), an “orgy of evidence,” and are ready to send Barr to the gas chamber. Unfortunately, instead of confessing, Barr simply scrawls “Get Jack Reacher” on his confession sheet. Will Reacher come? Will he take the case and find out the truth or will he hop a bus out of town and make this the shortest feature film ever released by Hollywood? If you can answer those questions, I’m afraid nothing that follows will surprise you either. Casting must have been fun though. I’m guessing that you, like me, are a fan of Michael Raymond-James, although his presence here (and the whole land development plot) only reminded me of how much more I like Terriers. Jai White makes a better impression as an icy-cold hired gun. And you got to meet filmmaker Werner Herzog. I assume, at least. He may have been chosen to play the villain for you in a Cruise script note that said “Werner Herzog type,”. But his calm, classically German Herzoginess seems to have been employed as a distraction from a woefully underwritten mastermind. Did I forget to mention Rosamund Pike as a crusading defence lawyer? I guess I’m giving her character as much attention as the film does. This is a man’s world written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie where character is defined through violence (although I have a feeling the source material is as much to blame). It even pauses to take a shot at “soccer moms” who are too timid to understand why guns are awesome.   And that’s why Reacher is the hero of this story: he’s the best at killing, with guns or otherwise. In one scene, he even manages to curb-stomp a man without a curb. Jack Reacher is the curb.

Whatever crazy request Tarantino had, you managed to make it work. “I need a horse have its head blown off. And another who goes in circles. And one with pretty spots. Trudge that one through deep snow. And all the horses over there – blow them up.” No wonder he bragged about your work so early in the credits, stating how no animals were harmed during filming. The experience of making Django Unchained must have been similar to watching it – a crashing booming spectacle. It’s an inglourious and propulsive mashup that it has little time for questions or answers, because it is so completely compelled by awesome. The premise and storyline directly support this commitment. Django (a 100% bad-ass Jamie Foxx) is freed from slavery in return for helping Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter, identify his next kills. The two team up, earning more bounties, until they turn their attention to freeing Django’s wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the slave driving clutches of Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson). The good guys are capable, the ladies lovely, and the villains terribly evil. It’s a perfect setup for justifying just about anything that follows. But as I am sure you know, even simple premises risk falling down in execution. Especially when they are Tarantino-complex. Like a broad collection of horse-and-rider stunts, the entire movie is an assemblage of scenes and ideas developed elsewhere. We’ve seen this all before – in Mandingo, Drum, Roots, The Searchers, The Wild Bunch, and more. The thing is, an old trick in a new environment can work wonders on an audience. So the result is almost completely enjoyable. All the actual horse stunts were flawless, to my eyes. Ambition met skill perfectly. The film itself, on the other hand, sometimes trips and falters while trying to combine so much at once. At almost three hours, pacing becomes crucial, and some scenes limp instead of gallop. Tarantino’s cameo falls flat on it’s face. And a few times, I was left wondering if a scene was actually going anywhere. The audience laughed every time Samuel L. Jackson said anything, which was confusing, but a credit to the zeal with which Jackson actually donned metaphorical blackface. Django Unchained’s failures are borne out of Tarantino’s love of his ideas and influences (his own metaphorical blinders), but because it comes from a good place, like a loyal steed, I’ll forgive him. Even if it’s not his best performance.

As an officer of the law for 35 years, it’s no surprise you prefer movies where the action is unchained and the emotions are unsung. Most guys do. But over the holidays, in the spirit of the season, you dutifully ignored the more enticing options in the cineplex to keep the family together. In the words of the story’s antagonist Javert, you probably thought “I will join these little schoolboys, they will wet themselves…” with tears. And we did. And it was glorious. And to the disgust of your iron-clad masculinity, even you must have been moved.  How could you not be? The international sensation Les Misérables is a pop opera that packs more emotion per measure than most productions could ever dream. Director Tom Hooper has created a genuine thrill-a-minute motion picture that somehow balances the bombastic tendencies of Broadway musicals with the intimate demands of filmmaking. He boldly does so by marrying one of the most powerful tools of the stage—live singing—to the silver screen’s own weapon of choice: the close up. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if you felt a little too close to the action. The film opens grandly, with a powerful rendition of Look Down that embraces the scale of the 19th Century France to great effect. You yourself may have felt like the officer Javert (Russel Crowe), observing the toils of forced labour below you. We then quickly meet our antagonist, prisoner 24601 Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), who is incredibly gaunt from his 19 years in shackles. He is released, and continually wronged, until an act of kindness inspires his rebirth. And at the moment he screams to the heavens “Jean Valjean is nothing now, another story must begin,” I knew this movie was in the right hands. Even you must have even felt the stirrings of emotion – that most dangerous of enemies to the law. If not, surely Anne Hathaway inspired you by her performance as Fantine, the impoverished mother who will do anything—anything—to save her daughter. Her signature number, I Dreamed a Dream, is devastatingly powerful and performed in a single take close-up. Even with minimal context, like when Susan Boyle sang it on Britain’s Got Talent, that incredible tale of fallen hope can rise to dizzying heights. But here, we can almost see the fading flicker from Hathaway’s eyes as she unearths the soul of the song. Is it the most technically accomplished rendition? Of course not. That’s what the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast concert is for. This performance belongs uniquely to this film. In fact, prioritizing character over concert is the revolutionary strength to this entire adaptation. On My Own by Éponine (Samantha Barks) is the other showstopper, and once again you may have felt like a prisoner to a close-up. But her face is easy on the eyes and the song is easy on the ears, so the only thing that will hurt is your heart. And that’s okay! Just like Jesus Christ Superstar is no preachy Sunday sermon, Les Mis (as we musical geeks call it) is far more than a tale of woe and sorrow.  But it is designed to make you feel empathy, and probably does so in a way even the Broadway production couldn’t always accomplish so clearly with such a rotating characters. Still, I’m sure part of you resisted, since “singing is for girls” (or something like that). But come on, when the key cast members meld their individual theme songs to their pre-battle melody of One Day More, it’s a rousing mid-show climax that’s basically the musical equivalent of watching The Avengers of Misery. But unlike a comic book, these underdog heroes are devastatingly mortal. Their failed plight is based on the ambers of the French Revolution that took more than a century to ever find its storybook ending. And I think it’s that cold hard truth which finally won you over.  We couldn’t expect you to share the enthusiasm of your wife and daughter (who flew to Chicago three weeks ago to see the musical again), or accept my pitch that it’s a story about blood and revolution. To that last point, you just looked at me unimpressed and reasserted your conviction: “It’s a chick flick.” Maybe you’re just afraid of what happened to Javert when he broke his strict moral code to show compassion.

In your line of work, if the audience senses a false note, the spell you cast can easily be broken. You’ve got to know exactly when to be smooth and convincing, and when to ratchet things up a notch. But how far do think you could take that auditory power of suggestion?  According to your new film Compliance, terribly, terribly far. Written and directed by Craig Zobel, the story is inspired by true events (and, according to some news stories, seems to stick pretty close to the facts.) It’s about a prank call to a fast food restaurant that resulted in the stripping and sexual assault of a young female employee.  A rather gullible manager (Ann Dowd) is told by a supposed police officer over the phone that one of her employees (Dreama Walker) is suspected of stealing.  What follows would sound almost impossible believe, if it hadn’t actually happened. That’s enough to compel our interest, but does the twisted tale hold up as a film? Just barely.  The story wisely opens broad enough to introduce us to a wider cast of characters. Some will weave in and out of the main storyline, which is eventually confined to a storage room. And for the first half of the film, Officer Daniels’ identity (Pat Healy) is left to our imagination. But about half way through (after most people would have realized something was wrong), we get to actually see the face behind the voice.  And until then, the performance is rather confident and persuasive.  After the trickster is revealed, we quickly feel above our characters. As you can imagine, that sort of kills the magic. Compliance doesn’t qualify as a horror film, but it’s just as uncomfortable as one.  When it succeeds, it’s more of a character study than an excise in exploitation. The last shot in particular, elevates our understanding of what happened by wryly introducing an important ingredient to the manager’s personality. What’s less satisfactory is the actual climax of the affair, which is done tastefully (pun intended), but is treated with the least conviction. Perhaps you filmmakers knew it was the hardest logical gap to bridge and therefore didn’t even try. But how else can you convince us? Accepting the fact is not enough, you need to sell us on the story. And obviously that’s not impossible.

Calling it a film noire just because of the setting would be highly inaccurate. Calling it a true story because it’s based on a few factual events (which it is) is like calling it a remake—after all, it borrows liberally from The Magnificent Seven (a remake in itself). And still I want to sing the praises of this film. The dialogue is deliciously pulpy and the action moves at a generous clip. On the other hand, I can’t help but call out its shortcomings. Please, just hear me out before you decide whether or not to slit my throat.  Set in Los Angeles in 1949, we follow an off-the-books police unit tasked with terrorizing mobsters. Their primary target is the infamous Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), an ex-boxer from the East Coast who exults in a vicious brand of business. John O’Mara (Josh Brolin) is the first of many WWII vets asked to use his extensive experience in warfare to shoot first and ask questions never. He recruits a team of misfit officers whose spotty discipline records mean they aren’t at risk of ever being promoted or bought off. Ryan Gosling, Robert Patrick, Anthony Mackie, Michael Peña and Giovanni Ribisi round out the team, and they waste precious little time following Nick Nolte’s awesomely illegal order to kick ass. So far, sign me up. Along the way, Emma Stone rolls between both parties as aspiring actress Grace Faraday. Stone has looks and charm to spare, and finds herself, refreshingly, on equal footing with Gosling after being gobsmacked by the man in Crazy. Sexy. Love. For his part (and probably to your interest), Gosling employs a slight vocal affectation that harkens back to the wise-cracking sidekicks of the 1950s. He plays a cool but self-interested greaseball, and delivers, in his nasally why-I-oughta voice some of the films best lines: “This whole city’s underwater and you’re grabbing a bucket instead of a bathing suit”. When dialogue like that lands right, it makes me smile. You must have felt the same way. But, in what feels like a misguided tribute to Chinatown, the movie forgets itself when it gets to…Chinatown. Suddenly the whole plan goes wrong, but somehow not wrong enough. The film clearly isn’t trying to delve too deeply into the shadows, but it certainly would have benefitted from being as bold and careless as its characters. Instead, a neat and tidy voiceover bookends the story and softens the punch. This isn’t the film’s only fault, but you know how these things go, kid. Someone’s gotta pay for a screw up. Even if it’s da wrong guy.

On December 26th, 2004, one of the deadliest natural disasters in history took near apocalyptic levels of life, claiming close to 240,000 souls. In dramatizing the phenomenon, you were responsible for recreating the raging waters of the Boxing Day tsunami that transfix us in The Impossible’s cataclysmic event. And like those unsuspecting people watching the oncoming wave, I found myself unprepared to be so moved by what I saw. Based on the true story of one family at the centre of the storm, director Juan Antonio Bayona wastes little time with set-up. Marie and Henry (Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor) arrive at their Thai resort for Christmas with their three young sons. Here they enjoy the serene waters of the Andaman Sea and picture perfect weather as they swim in the pool of their resort. That is until the unanticipated rapids come rushing in, which you rendered convincingly terrifying. And no matter how controlled the filmmaking conditions may have been, it’s hard to consol our fear as audience members by telling ourselves what we see is “just a movie”.  After what initially feels like a cheated cut to black at the moment of impact (a harrowing reveal reserved for later in the film), Marie suddenly emerges from the waters gasping for air and grasping for her survival.  The look of terror and heartbreak that she channels while clinging to a tree combines the realization of hopelessness in an incomprehensible situation with the pain of having likely lost her entire family. That’s when she hears the cries of her oldest son (Tom Holland) and instinctually lets go to try and reach him. As an expert in these matters, you would have undoubtedly consulted her differently, since her body smashes and rips against the collection of debris rushing along with her. The underwater photography—in this sequence and later in the film—is truly remarkable, forcing us to recoil with every moment of impact. The waters eventually calm, but the story never loses its momentum. The two escape the muddy wake of destruction and make their way to a hospital, which only magnifies the scale of the chaos. The fear of water is then replaced by a lack of medical support and a parallel search by other family members.  Despite committing the most common of Hollywood sins and “white-washing” the cast (the real-life family was Spanish, and this film is financed in Spain), the story manages to preserve what galvanized the world when the incident occurred. The immeasurable suffering of people an ocean away inspired universal empathy. The film balances this by offering a glimmer of hope, while also acknowledging that this family’s experience was extraordinary in an already extraordinary circumstance. It’s a simply plotted but engaging film, and be damned if I wasn’t swept away by the thing.

So here’s a movie where Jason Segel plays an aimless 30-something named Jeff, who lives at home… and spends his days getting high and contemplating the universe’s larger mysteries in his mom’s basement. This manifests itself in his obsession with M. Night Shyamalan’s 2002 sci-fi thriller Signs. Jeff finds beauty in that film’s climax, where all the characters’ random quirks and past histories play an essential role in saving the day. He wants to believe that his own life is also moving towards a similar moment that will reveal his own reason for existing. Just like in the movies.  After a few unrelated instances involving the name Kevin, Jeff starts to believes he’s meant to follow his own set of signs. This begins a day in which Jeff’s wanderings, the crumbling marriage of his brother (Ed Helms), and a possible office romance involving Jeff’s mother (Susan Sarandon) all lead to an unexpected and satisfying conclusion.  For writer/director brothers Mark and Jay Duplass, this film marks a bit of a departure from their earlier, more improvised works. It still feels loose, but everything is definitely leading somewhere specific. It all comes together so nicely. The character beats pay off; and while the notion that everyone has a role to play in life isn’t exactly new, it’s presented in an emotionally rewarding way. I thought it might seem a little tidy, but that’s allowed to happen in the movies. And then there I am, reading the closing credits for Jeff, Who Lives at Home, and one of the very last names listed is yours. The last seconds of an American movie about the way life creates connections in unexpected ways suddenly brings up your name.  I know you. I work with you. You sit beside me. We live in Ottawa.

It’s all about tempo, rhythm, building something whole and linear from disparate pieces. Like the baton-waving conductor who keeps time at the dais in front of an orchestra, you bear a heavy responsibility: arranging a suite of virtuoso performances. In the case of your new feel-good film Quartet, the virtuosos are some of the British stage and screen’s most notable performers: Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly, Pauline Collins, and everyone’s favorite dowager sourpuss, Maggie Smith. Unfortunately for them (and for their formidable talents), Quartet is a familiar piece of music. There’s the charitable institution fallen on hard times (an old-folks’ home for the musically inclined), a scrappy scheme to raise funds (a big show for the local townsfolk), and elderly people overcoming their fear of old age to indulge in the thrills of their youth (we tread dangerously close, at one point, to one of them breaking into a rap). That you’re working with a first-time director (some wide-eyed upstart named Dustin Hoffman) makes your job slightly more difficult. There is evidence of corrective measures throughout: cutting into similar shots, awkward fades to black between scenes. Hoffman moves the camera a lot, and you do a good job of finding purpose in it, even if you have to occasionally cheat the rules of filmic language to get from one shot to the next. The most obvious of these cheats is the very last cut of the film. In the seconds before the climactic performance starts – with all of our stars finally back on the stage, perhaps for the last time – we cut suddenly to a magic-hour exterior crane shot of the building, over which we hear their operatic quartet begin. Would it have been more graceless to reveal, through the magic of sound editing, the booming voice of a mezzo-soprano coming out of little Maggie Smith? Or a tenor’s bellow from Billy Connolly’s open mouth? Who can say—but it certainly felt just as dishonest to abandon our characters at the very moment their strife, struggle and doubt is finally overcome. In the end, the familiar tune is well-played. But only in the same manner that “Frere Jacques” might be well-played by the London Philharmonic. Great artists cruising too easily through elementary material.

Consultants are by nature pretty specialized, hired for their expertise in a given field.  But your title implied a refusal to be pigeon-holed; you were defining your expertise on your own terms. And it struck me: what could be more perfect for someone working on a film that refuses the same basic consideration? In telling the story of the decade-long hunt for Osama Bin Laden, Zero Dark Thirty doesn’t spell out what it’s supposed to mean—it leaves that work to the audience. Like screenwriter Mark Boal, Zero Dark Thirty is your second collaboration with director Kathryn Bigelow after working together on The Hurt Locker. And also like that film, Zero Dark Thirty’s tone is right down the middle: events are shown without commentary and almost without emotion. Bigelow and Boal are in their element detailing the minutiae of procedure. And like them, their characters are defined through their work and actions. Each one—NSA Technician, Navy Seal, Black Site interrogator—creates his or her identity through craft. It’s no coincidence that one of the titles used to break the film into chapters is “Tradecraft.” It’s one of these experts, a CIA analyst named Maya (Jessica Chastain in a performance commendable for its sparseness), who leads us through ten year’s worth of interrogations, missed connections, and dead ends. Although she is only a mid-sized cog in the giant CIA machine, Maya’s almost fanatical devotion  to her work creates the drama that propels Zero Dark Thirty’s narrative. This matter-of-fact approach may seem at odds with a subject matter that stirs so many emotions, but Boals and Bigelow are canny enough filmmakers to know that holding back can increase the impact. This was perfectly evidenced in the film’s opening, constructed solely from distress calls made from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Rarely—perhaps never—have I been so aware during a screening that everything to which I’m responding, both intellectually and emotionally, is being dictated almost entirely by me. Zero Dark Thirty acts like a feature-length version of the second shot in a  Kuleshov test; the film’s meaning is created in conjunction with the viewer’s beliefs. If you want Zero Dark Thirty to support something you already held going into it, you can mold it into that form. Is it problematic that Bigelow and Boals seem to have no clear judgment on the subject of their own film? Perhaps, but I find it fascinating; and like Chastain’s Maya, I relished looking for the connections (created here through filmmaking—or tradecraft, if you will), that may reveal some of the artist’s intent. And I do think those connections are there: the use of those aforementioned chapter titles, for example, and specifically the precise way dates are used, may actually condemn the (tremendously staged and filmed) climax as a continuation of a cycle of violence rather than catharsis. But I have a feeling I don’t need to convince you, whatever it was you actually did in the movie, of the benefits of keeping your identity open to interpretation.

Yoo, Screenplay Translator, Hollywood has a wonderful tradition of attracting the world’s biggest film stars. The biggest proof has to be Arnold Schwarzenegger, despite an incredibly awkward early career and this new, strange, career twilight phase you’re a party to. But he’s far from alone. In fact, The Last Stand is equally notable for being South Korean genre specialist Kim Jee-woon’s English language directorial debut, despite his not speaking any English. So the task fell to you to make sure nothing was lost in the translation of this all-American themed action-western adventure that essentially pits the Terminator against The Good, The Bad and the Weird. The result is a big messy mash-up that harnesses awkward charm to meet entertaining ends. The casting alone personifies the film’s warm embrace of the bizarre. Schwarzenegger plays a small town sheriff enjoying the quiet life after a bloody drug bust went sour in Los Angeles. His deputy is played by the always enjoyable Luis Guzmán, who can out-funny talk almost anyone who calls English a second language. That is, until Peter Stormare graces the town with his obscure accent and dubious plan to smuggle (read: violently shuttle) a Mexican drug lord across the border. Schwarzenegger must, therefore, round up a rag-tag of heroes that includes ex-solider and current jail-house lock-up Rodrigo Santoro, who boasts the sexiest ill-command of English in the bunch. The film might as well include the subtitle In the Land of Funny Accents, but that probably wouldn’t sell. Instead, the posters make a big deal of Johnny Knoxville’s presence, but your script is much less interested why his character is included, beyond a nominal plot purpose at the end. Ironically, a film like this may never have been designed for American audiences. A lot of clumsy nuance can be forgiven when subtitles are slapped over a performance. If the story works, the action is convincing, and the pacing feels right, a lot of nitpicking would be lost on foreign audiences (that ever-growing box office market). And to that end, the film gets a lot of things right. The early escape sequence in Las Vegas is impressive, the characters are given time to process and react to what’s happening, and a number of the action sequences (namely the cat-and-mouse chase in the cornfields) feel inspired. All of these elements play well to the genre, and feel like they’re working on an appropriately exciting, but not wildly over-the-top scale. Well, at least by American movie standards. For that reason, I’d say you did a pretty good job. The director obviously understands the universal film language of shooting underdog action picture. Even if the rest of production is working from a very basic translation. 진정으로 Christopher Status: Standard Delivery (3/5)  "},{"title":"Mirror, Mirror","url":"/2013/01/22/2mirror-mirror","date":"2013-01-22 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Eiko Ishioka, Costume Designer,  There are many reasons to make movies. Jon Peters tried for years to make a movie just so that he could see a giant mechanical spider onscreen. Sony rebooted a Spider-Man franchise barely a decade old just to maintain the creative rights to the character. And the entire second half of Nicolas Cage’s career seems to be an endurance test (for both him and audiences) in the service of paying off his income tax debts.  And what’s the reason for Mirror, Mirror? Well, that becomes clear about a third of the way through the film: swan hats. This was a real coup for you, Eiko. And clearly made the most of the opportunity – you’ve been nominated for an Academy Award! Congratulations! Talk about putting a feather in your cap. There’s also something admirable about director Tarsem Singh’s attempt to imbue a modern colloquial tone into a classical fairy-tale treatment of the Snow White story. Unfortunately, the substance of this movie seems to be not in the form, but in the style—much of which is expressed in your golden cloaks and stunning ball gowns and elaborate costume-ball get-ups (which is where we get to see the swan hats, the bunny-ears top-hat, the antler hat, etc.). That focus on aesthetics, while pleasant, comes with a price. The chemistry between Lily Collins and Armie Hammer feels wasted, Nathan Lane seems only to be operating at three-quarters efficiency, and Julia Roberts, who plays the wicked witch like the darkest timeline version of Vivian from Pretty Woman, can’t quite chew the scenery fast enough (and there’s a lot of scenery).  But what does it matter to you?

It’s not a very appealing prospect for any distributor, but you obviously had a plan. The end credits tell us that the U.S. Secretary of Defense saw this film and two days later, took a small first step at correcting a major flaw in the U.S. military justice system that was portrayed in the film.  It’s proof that the people who don’t want to see this film that are probably the ones that need to see it the most. And based on some alarming stats, there are a lot of people who need to see this movie. In The Invisible War, director Kirby Dick investigates sexual assaults in the U.S. military and reveals disturbing statistics about how many cases are outright dismissed. We’re not just talking about inappropriate comments, gestures or touching, but full-on rapes that leave women shattered for the rest of their lives.  Many become suicidal and most lose complete faith in the institution they entrusted with their lives. This is not subject matter that people are ever going to feel “in the mood” to watch, so you had your work cut out for you. The film opens with a classy intro weaving together the feel-good images of women joining the armed forces after the Second World War and gradually finding their places in the ranks. This optimism is then shattered by a chat roulette of confessions by women (and a man) who describe incidents in which they became victims of fellow soldiers they once considered “brothers.”  One woman explains being sent down “the gauntlet,” a hallway of up to 200 intoxicated men who had their way with her.  It’s not a pretty picture, and at least the audience is spared from any re-enactments. Because again, who would want to see this? About halfway through the film, the story changes from a series of talking heads to follow a few former soldiers trying to take legal action. Coast Guard veteran Seaman Kori Cioca first tries to claim personal medical damages and then joins a class action lawsuit against the Army. The film doesn’t invest much time in these pursuits (no doubt knowing there’s no simple solution), but at least this offers the film, and the victims, some forward momentum. The real boost, however, is likely to come from reactions to the film. Based on the film’s Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary, you knew exactly who to show this film to so that it would get noticed. The Academy does tend to love activist films, so I hope making the problem visible leads to serious reforms. I do feel like the subject is now a little more real to me, even if I’m not a very big fan of the pacing and perfunctory approach of the film itself.

You had me fooled.  I’m not exactly sure when I realized that Frédéric Boudin wasn’t playing himself in most of the re-enactment sections of The Imposter, but it took me a little while. We have plenty of time to examine his face in the interview segments, but a low-hanging ball cap and hoodie did a lot to curb my questions. Was this intentional on the filmmaker’s part? Of course! From an audience perspective, Boudin’s willingness to participate in the interview segments makes it conceivable he would simply play himself. But more importantly, this subtle deception helps us empathize with the film’s victims. It’s this type of dynamic storytelling that is reason I want to convince – not fool – people to see this film. The premise of this documentary seems rather improbable. A Frenchman convinces a Texas family that he is the 13-year-old son who disapeared three years earlier.  The stranger is not, however, just some lookalike who shows up on their doorstep one day. Frédric Boudin is flown from overseas to “rejoin” this family. It’s a ticking time bomb for an emotional meltdown, ratcheted up with stark, beautiful images and blunt first-person confessions. But can we really trust a narrator who paints himself to be a desperate master of deception?  These questions become key, especially during a major twist that had me gasp out loud. It’s a treat to discover a documentary this riveting. Director Bart Layton has a handle on pacing that would be the envy of most genre filmmakers.  The Imposter is the latest example of how well this format can work outside of the typical activist and education ghetto the public too often lumps it in with. And for you, I’m sure a gig’s a gig, but in the back of your mind you must have been thinking that no actor gets their “big break” in a documentary. But consider this: There are many schools of thought as to what constitutes great acting.  Some say it’s an art of illusion, others say self-revelation.

I don’t know whether they got the joke—since they used the footage—but they didn’t give you any credit. It was an appropriate critique of the whole project: it had been done before, and better, even by Burton himself. The story is pretty much what it says on the tin: boy loves dog, loses dog, reanimates dog, and said dog causes hijinks until the problem can be resolved. The thing I was watching most closely was the relationship of the boy, Viktor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan) with his dog. Losing an animal friend is terrible at any age; but for young children, it can be life changing. That’s dangerous territory, and seems to be the reason that Disney fired Burton back in 1984 when he first tried to make Frankenweenie. Apparently death was a no-no for early-80s Disney, (yeah, the company that made Bambi, Old Yeller. The Black Cauldron was probably even in production at the time they gave Burton the boot.). Getting fired for trying to make something you feel strongly about, early on in your directing career, can also be life changing. You might be afraid of any decision. You’d be jumping at shadows and seeing ghosts everywhere. What we get to watch now, in 2012, is a carefully-made movie that is full of ghosts. You yourself, Mr. Lee, are but a fleeting phantom. The scary issues around the death of a loved one disappear before you ever get a clear look at them. The movie itself is haunted by scenes from other movies. The references swirl by and pass through the story but leave it almost completely undisturbed. The plot itself is like something that would result from a ouji board séance: was it really there, or did the situation of sitting there in the dark just give me the impression there was one?  So what do you think, Mr. Lee? Was this movie an easy introduction to formative experience (filmic and personal) for kids?** Or is it a director awkwardly trying to deal with his own demons? If it’s the former, then it’s a nice, fun little movie that might encourage kids to learn what all those references are about. If it’s the latter, I think that Disney and the memory of what they did to him still scare the bejeezus out of Burton, and he is in need of an exorcism.  Yours in spirit,  Cory Status: Standard Delivery (3/5) *It’s not true. **I do believe that the rules for kid’s movies can play to different standards than adult’s movies.

I’m sure that it was a challenge stitching together the audio for a story that spans several continents as well as nearly four decades. But in telling the impossible-sounding story of the musician Rodriguez (née Sixto Rodriguez), director Malik Bendjelloul lets the music do as much of the talking as the various characters who weave in and out of the documentary narrative. It’s quite the narrative, too. After years of shuffling through the Detroit folk scene, some noted Motown producers were convinced Rodriguez could be the next Bob Dylan. But after releasing two albums to almost no sales, Rodriguez’s career was seemingly thrown into the discard bin of music. Except it wasn’t. Bootlegged copies of both albums made their way to the insular and apartheid nation of South Africa, where Rodriguez music became part of the national soundtrack, mentioned in the same breath as The Beatles and Rolling Stones (he’s often described as being “bigger than Elvis”). But with only two albums released and no other information available in the state-controlled country, Rodriguez’s fans came to only one conclusion: he was dead. The manner of his death changed depending on the storyteller: Did he light himself on fire as an act of protest? Was he shot? Did he overdose? The only point of agreement was that he must have died. The fate of Rodriguez is what drives the first half of the film. Criss-crossing between Detroit and South Africa, Bendjelloul holds off the outcome a touch too long; this wouldn’t be much of a search if there was nothing to find. But even in his physical absence, Rodriguez’s spirit is always felt through his music. You obviously realized that the best way to get an audience to understand how Rodriguez’s music could have captured a nation’s imagination is to simply play large parts the songs uninterrupted. Watching Rodriquez (at times animated) make his way through Detroit’s mean streets  focuses our attention on each song’s power – and gives insight into how they could speak so profoundly to people half a world away. It’s the man Rodriguez who’s really at the heart of this film, though. His story contains the most unlikely of second acts. And watching Rodriguez finally understand that his perceived failure actually inspired millions – and hearing him talk about it all in his own, soft-spoken voice – is the real gift.

And it’s this sort of thinking that propels the absorbing comedy Humpday as it follows two straight dudes struggling with the idea of boning each other.The act of having sex, of course, is secondary to the exercise of videotaping the whole experience as an “art project”. Best friends Ben (Mark Duplass) and Andrew (Josh Leonard) convince themselves, one drug- and alcohol-fueled night, that they could make an arresting entry into the underground “Humpfest” film festival by documenting their ability to overcome their sexual hang-ups.  The actual hook-up, however, is philosophized over and planned in a more sober mindset. The matter eventually morphs into a question of principals, morals, and independence when Ben’s wife Anna (Alycia Delmore) catches wind of their plan (and reacts appropriately).Humpday works so well as a dramatic comedy because it accomplishes the carefree and honest approach the two men are trying to capture in their alt-porn adventure. Lynn Shelton allows her camera operator to engage in Tom Hooper-type close-ups, as well as the freedom to pan around the room without ever breaking the moment. It’s also credit to the actors that they can perform so naturally when the fly on the wall is buzzing right in their faces. The dialogue is repetitive and overlaps when debates become heated, but the mediocre sound quality also lends itself to the “mumblecore” movement that Shelton and Duplass legitimized with this film. The whole thing is a joy to watch unfold. Most importantly, the filmmaking style doesn’t labour over lofty artistic obsessions like the two main characters do. It achieves an emotional honesty, with legitimate personal stakes that actually translate into wonderful tension and subtle displays of comedy.  It’s ironic that the film fits so well on the Netflix platform (where I saw it). Some things are just better when they’re done at home, privately. Wouldn’t you say?

Stick a couple of cameras in the Arctic and use time-lapse photography to provide irrefutable proof of global climate change. It’s a brilliantly simple concept, thought up by science enthusiast and National Geographic photographer James Balog. The complications of the expedition to actually achieve this, however, are wonderfully compelling. The whole exercise, I’m sure you’d agree, is actually profoundly moving – in more ways than one. The entire film is predicated on the ability to translate your static images (after they are sequentially animated) into an absorbing story. We follow Balog and his Extreme Ice Survey team as they first construct, then try to mount their cameras in harsh Northern conditions. The editing does a wonderful job of providing just enough context before an energetic montage shows cameras being positioned in 16 expeditions around the Arctic Circle. But after years of planning, Balog’s first return to the cameras months later finds them all either destroyed or malfunctioning from the brutal weather conditions. Frustrated by his inability to make his own mark on the world and the futility of his personal sacrifices (constantly leaving his family behind, completely wearing out his bum knee), Balog is moved to tears by his failure. New camera technology and younger crew members help re-energize the campaign, and soon the team is capturing breathtaking images, including a scene of the longest glacier calving event ever recorded. These seismic shifts are so arresting, they don’t even require you to speed up the images. The ice mountains literally roll and rumble; it’s a vision of true environmental apocalypse.. It’s amazing we’ve never seen this stuff before. For my part, I’m sad to admit that the only reason Chasing Ice registered on my radar is the backdoor Academy Award nomination the documentary received for Best Original Song (sung with sultry conviction by Scarlett Johansson). And although “Before My Time” is only featured during the film’s end credit sequence, this minimalist ballad is a good way to understand the appeal of this story. J. Ralph’s lyrics express the desire of not wanting to die alone, and in what could have been a painful exercise in anthropomorphism, director Jeff Orlowski lays the track over images of melting glacial ice caps. In the hands of a less talented activist filmmaker, I would have sharply resisted such contrived emotion. But because it comes on the heals of James Balog’s personal struggle, there’s a genuine human connection to associate with what we’re watching. It’s just one more example of the effective way Chasing Ice manipulates simple images at the service of telling a story.

Shocking, yes, I know. But before I can go any further, I need to ask you a few personal questions to verify that you’re the Jason Bateman we’re looking for.  Your earliest recurring roles were on which television shows? That’s right, Silver Spoons and Little House on the Prairie. And the 80s sitcom that cemented your B-level fame? The Hogan Family, correct. After that, having toiled for a while in TV-movie obscurity, which short-lived role transmogrified your career? Of course, yes, Arrested Development (though we also would have accepted Pepper Brooks in Dodgeball). Okay, thank you very much, Mr. Bateman. We can proceed.  Let’s run down the details of this incident so that we can clear this up.  Since building up professional equity as a member of one of the most dysfunctional television families of all time, your work history is rife with discrepancies.  An actor claiming to be you has appeared in a series of big-budget middlebrow comedies: Couples Retreat, Hit & Run, The Change-Up, The Switch (this last pair, apparently, are two completely different movies). Typically, he is the anally-retentive male half of an upper-middle-class suburban couple, occasionally as an officer of the law, but always as the parochial straight-man: conservative, anxious, always reacting with a sort of detached consternation to the buffoonery that surrounds him.  Identity Thief is the latest film in which this phony has leveraged your good name for personal gain. The buffoonery is provided by Melissa McCarthy, who falls and flails and curses and throat-punches as a colorful South Florida con-artist who steals the identity of a (you guessed it!) straight-laced suburban family-man. Mrs. McCarthy seems, in this role, to be her true authentic self (although there is a case pending due to her Will Ferrell-like similitude). But the Bateman-imposter coasts from opening to closing credits relying on the feints and parries you perfected on television but have never had the chance to fully explore in film. There’s a certain grace to playing the straight-man that you captured perfectly as Michael Bluth, and a gravitas to your inherent (and acerbic) seriousness that works wonders in the few dramatic roles you’ve been given. But we can spot a fake (it’s our job), and this con artist can’t hold a candle to you. Identity Thief ends up being another middling bit of February filler that isn’t amusing enough to resonate longer than the thirty seconds it takes to leave the theater.    This is also the second time your doppelganger has worked with director Seth Gordon (we’ll be contacting him, too: the atrophic disparity between King of Kong, his directorial debut, and his subsequent two films, have raised some suspicions about the security of his professional records, too). We hope to prevent such collusion from happening again.  Thank you for your time. We will immediately put a hold on all casting decisions bearing your name and begin taking measure to see that some of this lost equity is paid back to you in a timely fashion. Please log in to your Screen Actor’s Guild account and change your passwords. We’re glad to have cleared this up. Thank you very much, Mr. Bateman. Have a terrific afternoon.

A crazy king who wields both. This unruly combination propels A Royal Affair, a Danish historical drama about forbidden love, corrupt power, and The Enlightenment of 18th century Europe. At a time when your gentlemanly duels were quickly fading to a bygone age, this story exposes the death, havoc and heartbreak wreaked by backstabbing politics. So if you had any doubts that the stroke of a feather could do more damage than a thrust of steel, I hope this story taught you a valuable lesson. The movie begins in England, where a member of the British Royal Family named Caroline Matilda (Alicia Vikander) is sent to Denmark to marry King Christian VII (Mikkel Følsgaard). At first, it isn’t clear what to make of His Majesty and his alternating giggly or aloof beaviour, or even how to interpret his debauchedness. The King’s council, however, seek out medical advice, leading to the permanent employment of German doctor Johann Friedrich Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen), who keeps his personal radical, free-thinking, atheistic politics hidden. But as he gets closer to the King (and of course the Queen), he begins to exert incredible influence. This leads to royal reforms as well as the titular affairs, but as we’re warned early in the film, they would not last long.  Fighting against trappings of the genre, director Nikolaj Arcel keeps a safe distance from flailing melodramatics (Keira Knightly, take note). Følsgaard’s performance as the dependent and petulant king is wonderfully revealing, reminiscent of a more subdued Tom Hulce in Amadeus. There’s an interesting control in his undiagnosed mental illness, and its portrayal is as complicated and interesting as it troubling to the man himself. We watch him losing power as he loses interest in the governing process, and understand the importance that friendship plays in performing his official duties. The final stakes are that much higher as a result. The storytelling seamlessly shifts perspectives throughout, and never paints characters into a corner at the service of plot. The inevitable “royal affair” is the best example, as the resulting drama doesn’t unravel through lazy coincidences or feverish outbursts. The film is much more calculating with it’s jabs, and accomplishes a masterful final stroke. In the end, I was touched. Or as you fencers might say – touché!

But I bring you glad tidings. There’s one positive that you can take away from your incarceration: you won’t be able to see A Good Day to Die Hard anytime soon.  It may be hard for audiences to remember, but before Die Hard was released in 1988, action movies were populated mostly by grim, monosyllabic heroes. More Superman than everyman. Die Hard proposed something new: that an action hero could rely on his wits just as much as his firepower; that a certain amount of vulnerability made a character more endearing. Bruce’s Willis’s John McClane was noteworthy for the fact that he spent much of the movie trying to get himself out of the dangerous situation he had unknowingly become mired in. He knew he was outclassed and outgunned; he just wanted someone to take his calls for help seriously. The best testament to Die Hard’s revolutionary approach was how quickly it became shorthand for a new kind of action movie. The next decade saw every pitch described as “Die Hard on a [insert location and/or mode of transportation here].” Of course you had expert help in crafting the original film, John. Your direction was top-notch, but so was Jan de Bont’s crisp, shimmering cinematography. And the script by Seven E. de Souza was far more concerned with McClane’s relationship with his wife than his service revolver. So, if this group represents the A-team of action cinema, I guess that would make the filmmakers of A Good Day to Die Hard the Ω-team.  That’s right, I can’t even place them in the same alphabet as you. Maybe I need to be more methodical in my analysis. Let’s approach this the same way Alan Rickman’s Hans Gruber might when assembling his crack team: Skip Woods, screenwriter. Perhaps I should start off by admitting that after I watched A Good Day to Die Hard, I did a Google search to find out if “Skip Woods” is the screenwriting equivalent of “Alan Smithee”. But it’s not, which means that Woods intentionally chose to take all the elements that make a Die Hard film fun and unique – the single location, the interplay between McClane and his antagonist – and tosses them out completely. Instead, we see McClane travel from New York to Moscow to help his supposedly bad-seed son (Jai Courtenay, embodying the phrase “zero charisma”), who in reality is a CIA agent deep undercover. McClane Jr. is protecting a powerful Russian somebody from some other powerful Russian who wants to … well, none of that is clear. Not even, I suspect, to Skip Woods. Jonathan Sela, cinematographer. I feel bad for what you must have put Jan de Bont through, John. All those miles of track he had to lay to get those precise camera movements. Apparently all he needed to do was shake the camera around like it was trying to shake loose a piece of gum from his finger. Unless, of course, you wanted the audience to be able to tell what was happening onscreen. Which is something that apparently doesn’t concern Sela. John Moore, director. Here was have the criminal mastermind behind this enterprise. You may have missed this during you stay at Club Fed, John, but apparently the knowledge of how to piece together an actual coherent film is no longer a pre-requisite for employment in Hollywood. Moore is incapable of creating even the most basic onscreen geography to tell the audience where people are in relation to each other. Even in dialogue scenes, which use basic cinematic techniques perfected over that last eighty years, it’s impossible to tell who is talking to who, even when characters are supposedly in the same room. As you might be able to imagine, things don’t get any better when the film shifts into bombastic action. I can all-too-clearly picture Moore giving commands to editor Dan Zimmerman, who, acting as Theo to Moore’s Gruber, would delightfully exclaim with each cut, “And the spatial continuity IS toast!” With this group of men, we have a team of criminals that has finally pulled off what was never before possible: they have taken down John McLane.  But, as I said earlier, I write to cheer you up. Like all good Die Hard characters, I have a plan to reap some good from this disaster. You see, all we have to do is play a copy of A Good Day to Die Hard at your next parole hearing. After watching it, I don’t think any judge would deny you your freedom. You see, he’ll realize that by keeping you locked away, unavailable to provide any stewardship for this franchise, you’re not the one being punished. It’s all of us.

For you would be the first in the history of the world.” — Lancaster Dodd in The Master One of the most interesting revelations during my time at the Cannes Film Festival this year was learning that this most prestigious of film festivals offers a Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. Created by Christian filmmakers, film critics, and film professionals, the objective of the award is to “draw attention to those works of quality which touch the spiritual dimension of our existence,” and “reveal the mysterious depths of human beings”. Winners have ranged from predicable choices like Jesus of Montreal (1987) and Of Gods and Men (2010), to less obvious selections like Paris, Texas (1984) and Caché (2005). Considering the country’s strict laws of laïcité (the separation of church and state), I was both bemused and inspired that the French have such a distinguished public platform to acknowledge films that promote shared human values. I thought we should give it a shot. Over 90% of Americans still answer “yes” to the question of whether or not they believe in God. But exploring faith on film is primarily restricted to documentaries and Biblical epics.  That’s why it seems a minor miracle that more than a few major Hollywood releases in 2012 were willing to ask big questions—with various degrees of success. Here’s a look at the way six major films found God in 2012. The Tradition of Religion and Les Misérables  Rebirth is one of the most powerful themes in theological discourse. The idea that a person can right their wrongs in pursuit of salvation is central tenet of all religions.  It’s also at the very heart of Victor Hugo’s French novel Les Misérables, the story of a broken man who interprets an unexpected act of kindness as a divine second chance. Director Tom Hooper avows Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) as his Jesus-proxy early on, mimicking the Passion as the hero carries his cross (the French flag poll) under the orders of Pontius Pilate-stand-in Javert (Russel Crowe).  Valjean is then lost in purgatory, roaming the French countryside, before finding God the not-so-subtle form of a Catholic priest. Valjean’s resurrection is asserted when he vows “Jean Valjean is nothing now, a new story must begin”, framed by an overhead crane shot that ascends endlessly into the heavens and concludes the first chapter of the film. Years later, he meets his Mary Magdalene, Fantine (Anne Hathaway), and transitions from Son to Father, caring for her daughter, Cossette. By the end of his journey, he completes the Trinity. His Holy Ghost helps usher in a full-chorus finale: a gospel of melodies reflecting the revolution’s struggle for human dignity, justice, and freedom. The film isn’t just a parable about the power of forgiveness, but a metaphor about the healing effects of Christianity. We are compelled to take strength in the saints who came before us, live out the dreams they died for, and never forget their sacrifice. It’s all moving and unapologetically melodramatic, but to be a true believer, you’ll first have to forgive Russell Crowe’s singing.   The Recruitment of Worship and The Master  Primarily interpreted as a thinly-veiled portrait of Scientology, The Master tells the story of one man’s futile attempt to find greater meaning. The sexual and alcohol addictions of WWII veteran Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) ostracize him from others until charismatic leader Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) invites him to join The Cause.  But, despite Lancaster’s best efforts to win over his petulant disciple, Freddie never fully commits himself to purpose. This is less a refusal of their nascent doctrine than Freddie’s inability to give himself over to anything other than his own personal demons. Many people (myself included) were expecting the film to cast a critical eye on new-age religiosity—specifically its apocryphal origins, philosophies, and inner practices. No one is likely to be converted to The Cause after viewing this film (well, almost no one), since writer and director P.T. Anderson, much like Freddie, is uninterested in exploring the finer points of its theology. The Master indulges our curiosity with “processing sessions” and one outright debate on the meaning of the word “cult”, but we’re never asked to empathize or even evaluate the movement itself. Instead, lush visuals, compelling performances, and beautiful period details are simply at the service of compelling characters. There’s a wonderfully meditative rhythm to the film, but The Master never attempts to explore notions of a higher spiritual power; only the power that man can exert over others by exploting those ideals.

To read from the beginning, where we discuss Les Misérables, The Master, Prometheus, The Grey, and our inspiration for the essay, click here.  Part 3…  The Construction of Deity and Cloud Atlas  For all the dismissive criticism labeled against Cloud Atlas for being overwrought, simplistic and too concerned with a lightweight central premise that “we’re all connected,” there are many other threads that make this a rich film. In particular, the examination of how faith evolves over time, and how certain experiences are translated by later generations as divine parables that can help us deal with the future. More importantly, the film is a wonderful example of how their misinterpretation tells us everything we need to know about the present. Most prominent is the story of a young lawyer who witnesses the cruelty of slavery in the 1800s. His journal is the inspiration for a young musician in the 1930s to compose his masterpiece. The musician’s forbidden lover finds the diary and adopts it as a metaphor for his own struggles as a closeted homosexual. Years later, he passes the diary to an intrepid reporter involved in a corporate conspiracy. Her young neighbor grows up to adapt that story into a mystery novel, which is published by an editor who undergoes his own imprisonment in an old-folks home. The publisher eventually quotes a line from the book to empower his own escape. The novel is then adapted into a film, where, two hundred years later, the same line (“I will not be subjected to criminal abuse!”) becomes the catalyst for inspiring a rebellion in Neo Seoul. Future generations interpret these words as a prophecy from the synthetic being who spoke them, and worship her as a celestial being. No film since In the Name of the Rose has done such an effective job of exploring the how messengers shape our understanding of the Word of God.  Theologies are always thought to be infallible, but their distortion over time will always raise questions about original intent and authenticity. It’s the reason there will never be consensus about the existence of God; which God is the true God, in what form spirituality exists, and whether or not Cloud Atlas is a good movie.   The Interpretation of Faith and The Life of Pi  Ang Lee’s Life of Pi delivers the boldest of promises: Pi, the castaway protagonist, has a story that will make us believe in God. Jesus Christ never made such claims. Priests, rabbis, imams, monks and missionaries in the audience must have been elated: could this one film actually be adopted by all religions to replace a lifetime of sermons? Actually, yes, but only if you’re open to believing in… everything. In Yann Martel’s novel, when young Pi is marooned on a life raft with a deadly Bengal Tiger, the reader can understand the story as a fable.  But a visual meduim has to present the story more literally on the big screen.  Lee, therefore, does a fantastic job of transitioning back and forth between palpable reality and surreal serenity.  The harrowing tale may drift into the realm of fantasy, but it’s always grounded by emotional truths. And it’s the director’s ability to maintain these stakes throughout that sells the film’s final message. But how ambiguious are the film’s final moments?  Many people believe Pi made up the Tiger story to understand his own spiritual journey. Others say he gave the Japanese investigators a more plausible account only to appease their secuar parameters for understanding. However, when offered the choice of which story to report, the Japanese men choose the fantastical one with the Tiger.  Is this because they now accept Pi’s original account? Or because they simply want to respect his right to believe what he wants? Whatever the case, the important thing is that they show faith in their fellow man. The audience should also be thankful that M. Night Shyamalan (who originally had the rights) didn’t get to make the film —one can easily imagine that he would have simply exploited that last-minute twist for shock value.  The beauty of Life of Pi is that it respects your individual beliefs, and promotes the idea that faith is a form of comfort. Even if you take an atheistic approach and simply believe Pi made up the story, it’s a damn good story. One that, if nothing else, will make you believe in insurance fraud. So who ultimately wins the Silver Stamp of the Ecumenical Jury? Let’s follow Pi’s example and say everyone can judge that for themselves. Let us know what you think. After all, cinema is our religion.

By making Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) both an archeologist and spiritualist, the film sets up some elementary discussions about whether or not one needs to choose between formulas and faith to understand our existence. Despite her infertility, she’s gets pregnant but quickly discounts the miracle to explore the empirical side of the mystery. Her alien-baby implantation is proven to be a gambit by the mission’s sponsor (Guy Pierce) as he seeks to unnaturally prolong his own life. Matters get even messier when they discover The Engineer, an advanced alien who supposedly created life on Earth and now inexplicably wants to destroy it. Is there a message in all black gooey mess that pulses so hard for profundity? In a time when real-life scientists are trying to unlock the “God particle”, promote the values of stem cell research, and argue the ethics of cloning, there’s certainly no shortage of contemporary allegorical readings into the film. But, like worshiping a Jesus-shaped grease stain, it requires a pretty big leap of faith to turn this spectacle into a profound experience.  Perhaps we really were made in the image of a vengeful creator who now inexplicably wants to destroy us.  Maybe, as the ending suggests, science really will kill God and replace it with something even more terrifying. Or maybe mankind doesn’t deserve to survive in the first place, if our planet’s ambassadors are so damn inept.  The Importance of Doubt and The Grey  If you thought that a film featuring fistfights between Liam Neeson and a pack of wolves wouldn’t offer anything more than mindless entertainment, you’d be wrong. But you’re forgiven. In The Grey, Joe Carnahan has crafted an existential exploration on the will to live and, more importantly, find salvation. What was marketed as a simple tale about a group of oil workers who survive a plane crash in the wilds of Alaska might equally be understood with Lost-levels of metaphysical entanglement. The opening voiceover by Ottway (Liam Neeson) establishes his place in this frozen-over hell: “I don’t know why I’ve done half the things I’ve done, but I know this is where I belong. Surrounded by my own; ex-cons, fugitives, drifters, assholes. Men unfit for mankind.” He then immediately – and unambiguously – walks past a fluorescent crucifix and into a mess hall.  The story quickly lends itself to interpretations of a man in purgatory, caught between heaven and hell, light and dark; essentially, the grey. Ottway has lost his desire for redemption after the death of his wife, until a moment of reckoning (the plane crash) forces a final judgment on his soul.  His wife is imagined in beautifully overexposed whites, giving her an angelic presence and leaving little doubt as to where she ended up after death.  Ottway is convinced he’s not worthy of seeing her again, and only in proving his ability to overcome his personal demons (embodied by hyper-real, glowing-eyed wolves) will he find salvation.  If I sound snowblinded by what should be a straight-forward action adventure film, consider how the film’s most important moments resolve themselves. When Ottway first wraps his lips around the barrel of his high-powered rifle, he is interrupted by howling wolves. It’s only upon hearing these demons that he reflects on the consequences of his actions (suicide is an “unforgivable sin”, according to some churches).  When the plane crashes, he has a final vision of his wife being ripped away, and emerges from the snow, born again. The crash is his baptism. His first action as group leader is to offer last rites to a dying man, as all the others confirm “feeling” something (a spiritual transition) the moment the victim passes on.  At this point, he essentially becomes Ottway the Exorcist, trying to save the souls of the other men “unfit for mankind.” He’s ultimately unsuccessful (after all, it’s up to each man to save himself) and even the success of his own salvation is open to interpretation. This suggests, I suppose, it takes more than broken glass taped to your knuckles to face your fears and find God. << RETURN to PART 1 of 3         CONTINUE to PART 3 of 3 >>"},{"title":"5 Broken Cameras","url":"/2013/02/21/5-broken-cameras","date":"2013-02-21 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Emad Burnat, Director,  The conflict in the West Bank has been going on for so long, in such familiar ebbs and flows, that one can hardly fault the exhaustion of Western attention. As intifada gives way to uneasy détente, as Arab Spring turns to Arab Fall,  the perpetual strife in the Middle East comes to us as an abstraction that flashes for a few minutes on the evening news, or as truncated Twitter headlines that accompany unclicked links.  But what you’re able to give us in the hundreds of hours of footage you shot over a five year period in your village, the Palestinian outpost Bil’in, is a humanity that such bite-sized bits of impartial journalism simply can’t capture. The result is the Oscar-nominated documentary 5 Broken Cameras, which follows the fate of your farming community as it protests the construction of the West Bank barrier and fights against the encroachment of Israeli settlers.  Some of the images are familiar: the seasick shaking of the frame as the photographer flees from crackling flash grenades (a blur of feet and sky and fleeing faces); the street-level wreckage after a confrontation between protesters and security forces (flames and crumbled concrete and far-off wailing). But it’s the moments in between these eerie scenes that are most striking. Only someone as close to the conflict as you would know well enough to seek them out, to linger, to let them play out. An Israeli special forces unit, undercover as Palestinian dissenters, reveal themselves by hurling the first stones during a peaceful protest. A protester, already in custody, cuffed, calm, is casually shot in the leg in the style of a summary execution.  In many of these moments, the camera is up close to the action; mere feet away (inches, in some cases), and captures an intensity of emotion that news cameras rarely do. What shows through, from this intimate vantage, is true impartiality, not merely the illusion of it: nowhere is this more evident than in the defeated, almost apologetic way that an Israeli soldier reads his eviction orders when you and your family are ordered to vacate your home in the middle of the night. Often you somehow manage to find a perch behind Israeli forces, and shoot from their point-of-view as they fire tear gas and rubber bullets into the fleeing crowd. This is no impartial piece of journalism (nor is it meant to be) but we get a sense – in camera perspective, at least – of what it’s like on the other side of the fence.  This isn’t a film meant to comment broadly upon the historical struggle for Palestinian statehood, either. It’s about a very specific place, a very specific time, and very specific community of people. And through this relatively narrow perspective that the broader truth about the Arab-Israeli conflict is revealed. In this context, the sight of an olive tree engulfed in flames is evidence of an unspeakable atrocity; a single death, occurring with frightening speed and simplicity (a loud crack, a ragdoll collapse), is a proxy for the hundreds of thousands of deaths that preceded it.  Whatever parts of the film are manufactured (and only rarely do those seams show through, in too-convenient third-party footage and narrative bits built through self-conscious editing) are easily forgiven, if only for the fact that two of your cameras are destroyed during physical assaults, and two others are, literally, shot out of your hands. Even during the quiet moments you spend documenting the first years of your fourth-born son’s life, danger is always present at the edge of the frame. Midway through the film, you observe: “When I film, I feel like the camera protects me. But it’s an illusion.” The illusion, however, is ours: that the plight of the Middle East can be explicated through punditry and press-releases and 140-character summaries of political maneuvering.

Or is it brilliance? In 1947, inspired by the legend of Kon-Tiki, Thor Heyerdal put a theory to the test: he believed the Polynesian Islands were inhabited by South Americans and not Asians (as was commonly thought), and therefore sought to recreate the voyage they would have taken to get there. Much like you had to do 65 years later to make this film. I just hope your crew cut a lot more corners. We’re introduced to Heyerdal as a child, and, after a near-death experience belies his willingness to take risks, we catch up with him years later as he is ensconced on the Polynesian Islands doing scientific research. It’s a romantic period in his life—one that foreshadows his future obsessions. Soon we’re in 1940s New York as he trying in vain to publish his migration theory. This is an extremely economical narrative that never wastes a frame on tangential elements. The cinematography, set design, and visual effects are meticulous, lending gravitas to a lush and beautiful film. Once Heyerdal assembles his ragtag crew, we are treated to a view of the vessel Kon-Tiki. Built only with materials that could have been sourced 1000 years ago, Heyerdal’s pedantic (and possibly fanatical) attention to historical accuracy provides much of the drama.  Will the ropes hold?  Will the log base decay? Although the crew brings a radio so that they can report on the voyage, they must accept that help is a world away. It’s easy to see why this true story is so popular in Norwegian history. The visual treatment might be less hallucinatory than this year’s other lost-at-sea epic Life of Pi, but the flying fish and phosphorescent deep-sea creatures are just as compelling. These rarely seen natural elements add a wonderful mysticism to the story without ever dragging it too far into the realm of fantasy. The final moments are also sobering and capture the emotional toll of the journey. In the end, I don’t’ think I would have trusted the actual raft. But I felt extremely comforted by your recreation.

Your production company, micro_scope, is arguably the hottest shop in Canada. You’ve been so busy making great films and earning Academy Award nominations that you haven’t even had time to update your English home page in four years. In fact, let’s go back to that period. You were about to re-team with Philip Falardeau “in the summer of 2010” to create “Bashir Lazhar” (Monsieur Lazhar) and were “putting the last touch on Denis Villeneuve’s next feature, Incendies.” At this point of your career, I think you would have been a little more disciplined about bringing a movie like Inch’Allah to the big screen. On paper, however, everything looks great. This is the story of Chloé (Evelyne Brochu), a French Canadian doctor working at a women’s health clinic, who slowly starts to lose her impartiality in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She is close friends with a female Israeli border guard (Sivan Levy), but spends most of her time with a pregnant Palestinian girl named Ran (Sabrina Ouzani). When Chloé witnesses a young boy being killed by Israeli soldiers, she starts to take sides, which could be dangerous to her practice. But the stakes are never made compelling, and Inch’Allah’s filmmakers could be criticized for treating these events with the same emotional disinterest for which they accuse the Israeli media.  The film half-heartedly foreshadows an explosion from the final moments, which certainly provides some necessary impact, but nothing between the three major plot points seems to matter. The film meanders between bond fires, clinic treatments, car sales and Skype conversations that never advance the story and only provide minimal character insights. By the end, the “hero” is portrayed as one of the most ineffectual protagonists I’ve seen in years. She’s simply an audience surrogate with too many close-ups of her face as she goes from place to place, unable to make a meaningful relationship or positive impact anywhere. This point, if it’s trying to be made, feels more suited for a lecture than a film.  And yet, this is a far more accomplished film than many. It’s just you’ve set such high expectations that I can’t help but be disappointed. You see, in a strange way, the existence of Incendies actually hurts this film. Our first impressions of Inch’Allah are of a French Canadian woman wondering through the Middle East. Combine this with leveraging Incendies on the poster for Inch’Allah, and a mildly informed audience could expect another densely packed, emotionally harrowing drama. But of course, an artist never wants to look repetitive (yes, producers can be artists too) and you must have been itching for something “new.” So you may have let relatively unproven writer and director Anaïs Barbeau-Lavalette indulge bad habits that someone more experienced like Philip Falardeau is now able to avoid. As a result, Inch’Allah can’t sustain the casual but compelling pace of Monsieur Lazhar and is miles away from the gripping political firestorm of Incendies.  Ultimately, Inch’Allah is far from a blemish on your stellar filmmography, but I can pretty much guarantee it won’t be used to sell any of your next projects.

Although you had, I am sure, great help from talented people, this is a compelling and passionate work that was obviously made with a singular vision. And the results are wonderful. This is a tight, focused, and surprising little documentary that moved me in ways I was wholly unprepared for.  It begins with the 1999 execution by the Taliban of a woman in the Olympic stadium where the girls now practice. From there, it follows the budding boxing careers of three young girls, training under a one-time Olympic athlete that lost his chance to compete in 1984 in Los Angeles because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. They face fearsome international competition abroad, and celebrity, criticism and even outright threats at home.  The boxing girls themselves are brave, and the movie is clear about how unique they are in their society. Family support and hope for a better future is a key enabler – with two of the girls’ mother adamant that Afghanistan “can’t go backwards.” The coach is a warm and dedicated man, who is proud and supportive of his boxers, and like them consciously risks death to do so. As a viewer, you get the sense that some of the chaos in Afghanistan is incomprehensible even to its residents. Their only possible response to the larger dangers is a wary resignation that other, more fortunate kids reserve for the weather. The material demands of making a movie like this definitely show in the cinematography. There probably wasn’t much opportunity for quality cameras and good lighting, especially in something so fast-paced as boxing. After the first dozen minutes of the film, I had started to give up on cinematography, when I was struck by crystal-clear shots of the city, with beautiful light cascading through the clouds. It does a great job of establishing the place, and these lovely shots serve as a palate cleanser for the majority of the relatively jumpy and pixely camera work. You are a talented cinematographer working in some rough circumstances.  The structure of the film, even though it only runs an hour, is superb. It first spirals in an ever-widening circle, from the boxing studio to the stadium, to the marketplace, to the girls’ homes to the city of Kabul, to the situation in Afghanistan to the international competitions. When they visit other countries for the first time, like Vietnam and Kazakhstan, we know the strangeness of the places because we see through the girls’ eyes. From there, the movie spirals back in, to the resulting personal changes and possible future of these girls.   There are no big plays or solutions, but again, there don’t need to be. The fact that these precious people exist is astonishing in itself, and the fact that you captured them is a gift.

That’s right, we’ll be reviewing the winners in each category, from Best Tantrum Tamer, to Best Bromance, to Best Hangover Cure (we’ll even make sure to be appropriately soused so that it’s a genuine experience). If you want us to watch Eat Pray Love, then gosh durnit, we will! Visit the Flixies website right now to see the nominees and cast your votes, then visit Dear Cast and Crew to see what we have to say to the people behind the magic. Until then, enjoy our very own Flixies Picks – for both Netflix Canada and U.S.!    Christopher:   Trailer Park Boys, because it rocks and I imagine Ricky asking “What in the fuck is a Best Commute Shatner?” Cory:   Aziz Ansari: Intimate Moments. Top Gear guys are jerks, TED is vapid, and Portlandia is way too cute.  Nothing better prepares me for the commute and work than the little dose of the insanity and misanthropy that is Aziz. Christopher:   Shark Week.  I like so many people find these misunderstood sea monsters hypnotic. I could end up at either ocean before I came to. Cory:   Louis C.K. Chewed UP – nothing better prepares me for the commute and work than the little dose of the reality and hope and misanthropy that is Louis C.K. Casey:   Portlandia.  Being a sketch show, it’s already broken up into short chunks, so you  don’t even have to worry about being left hanging when you arrive at  your destination. The fact that it’s the best sketch show on TV right  now also helps. Jared:   The fantastical world of Portlandia – which grows  even more absurd in the second season – will seem almost like a  documentary when you’re watching it amongst the hemp-smelling hippies  and eccentrics on your morning bus.  Christopher:   Again, Trailer Park Boys. I love Community, but those dudes talk too fast when your head already hurts.  Christopher:   What better way to slough off your day than re-watching Ferris Bueller’s Day Off? Casey:   Archer.  In any given episode, Sterling Archer is guaranteed to be more hung  over then you ever will be, and watching him crush it as an  international spy can only serve as an inspiration. Cory:   Agreed, Archer. The worst part of a hangover is  the regret and self-flagellation. Watching this show makes you feel  normal and well adjusted, which is a precious commodity nowadays. And  they talk so fast, you could watch the same episode three times and not  even mind. Also: it’s pretty. Jared:   The great-tasting, less-filling adventures of TV’s most  dysfunctional family is the hair-of-the-dog you need the morning after  getting so tanked you lift your shirt for a Girls With Low Self-Esteem  camera crew. Arrested Development all the way.  Christopher:   Machine Gun Preacher, only because it’s an excuse to promote my article Finding God in the Films of 2012. Cory:   Both Jackass and Braveheart are too honest and sincere to be comfortable to watch with brothers, friends, or romancees. Inglourious Basterds would be my vote if it had more actual bromance in it. Who’s driving this list? Estelle Getty? The Three Stooges win it by a landslide because the best part of men enjoying men is that they simply spend time together and don’t fuss about the details. Jared:   Brad Pitt and his ruffian gang of scalp-hunting Jews from Inglorious Basterds were World War II’s most dangerous bros: nowhere is this more clear than in the “Bear Jew” scene, as they lounge with their collars popped, cheering on their buddy as he crushes Nazi skulls like they’re cans of Bud Lite. Christopher:   Goon, Goon, GOON. How is this not available in Canada?? Cory:   I vote for Warrior, because brothers be trouble, and family is something worth fighting for. Jared:    Goon isn’t just the best bromance available for streaming on Netflix, it was one of last year’s most underrated films (and I’m not just saying that because I’m legally required).* *Please note: all Canadian citizens are required by law to espouse the natural virtues of all films that reference the game of hockey. Casey:   Justified. We all know Raylan Givens and Boyd Crowder were made for each other.  Christopher:   A Monster in Paris looks sort of tolerable. I guess? (Why did I just have a kid…) Casey:   Caillou. I once played a show alongside a band named Caillou. That’s all I’ve got for this list. (Instead, watch the original Transformers cartoon on Netflix.) Cory:   My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, because  I just learned there is a MLP mod for Dwarf Fortress. It was all quiet  until a fire imp jumped out of a cavern and set fire to a puppy. Two dwarves ponies died killing the imp and handling the puppyfire. The puppy  survived, but the goblins attacked and everyone ran out of beer. I will  watch MLP until this happens in the actual show. Either the world will  end or everyone will have calmed the fuck down by then. Christopher:   Well obviously The Muppet Movie. It’s incredibly watchable and I can drown out any kid while I sing along to Life’s a Happy Song, Party for One and the Oscar-winning ballad Man or Muppet. Wait, what? Wrong Muppet movie? I’m picking it anyway. And singing these songs with it too. Casey:   The Muppet Movie. It’s best to introduce children to the work of Orson Welles early. Cory:   My challenge here is that the better the movie is, the  worse it may fare as an actual tantrum tamer. If the tantrum is not my  fault, then they have to watch Transformers: Prime and keep crying. If it is my fault and I forgot to feed them or something, then they can watch something good, like The Muppet Movie. Jared:   A tantrum is a war of attrition, and Transformers: Prime will meet the cacophony of your child’s wild rage with an appropriate   level of noise and bombast—even if it doesn’t tame the tantrum, at least   it will drown it out.  Christopher:   Titanic. Re-watched it in 3D. Re-cried like a 12-year-old girl. And look! Another chance to link to a review. Casey:   I don’t even get these nominations. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Freaks and Geeks, Shawn of the Dead were all critically loved; where’s the guilt here? I could go ahead and say Bad Boys II as I hate Michael Bay, and this is the most Michael Bay Michael Bay’s ever been, which results in the best kind of hate-watching. But the Buffy fan in me—and the presence of Eliza Dushku— tips the balance to Bring it On. For all the wrong reasons. Christopher:   I’ve never seen Hoarding: Buried Alive, but I assume it would adequately fulfill reality TV’s role of having me look down on people. Casey:   Cruel Intentions. You see, it’s the cast of Buffy that make the best guilty pleasures, not the show itself. This is what must have confused the nominating committee. Cory:   I ain’t telling you guys nuthin’. What? Oh. Well, in that case, it’s Buffy. It’s  the only thing of Whedon’s that I haven’t seen, and I am sure I would  like it. If I had a pleasure I felt guilty about, this could very well  be it. Jared:   Guilt hits hardest when you indulge to excess. That’s why Bad Boys II,  which is the most indulgent and excessive of Michael Bay’s action  blockbusters (and that’s saying a lot) should make you feel the  guiltiest.  Casey:   Can I say none? This is a sad list of films and shows I haven’t seen. But since Nora Ephron wanted to be a less interesting Woody Allen, I vote for Midnight in Paris  Cory:   I will take Pride and Prejudice, because the Victorians knew how to hate people in general way before Bridezilla and Sleepless in Seattle. To be honest, I quite liked Pride and Prejudice and Jane Austen, but buy me a beer and I will tell you how Sense and Sensibility represents about 23% of what is wrong with the world today. Jared:   Bridezillas, because the best cure for PMS is a strong dose of someone else’s narcissistic self-indulgence. Casey:   I’ve never seen a single episode of Friday Night Lights, but I’m sure it’s better than anything else on this list. I’ll turn in my critic badge on the way out. Cory:   Holy shit, how is Friday Night Lights not on more of these lists? I was dragged kicking and screaming into watching it, and I couldn’t like it more. Beautifully shot, fantastically acted, and more American than even this American can handle. Jared:   Say Yes to the Dress, because the best cure for PMS is a strong dose of someone else’s narcissistic self-indulgence. Christopher:   Glee, because Netflix only has the first few seasons when the show was still fun.  Casey:   Mad Men because the best of the shows nominated by miles, and has more than one season to prove its quality isn’t a fluke. Also, where’s Justified in this list? (It would still be Mad Men.) Cory:   The fact that Battlestar Galactica, a series filmed largely in Canada, is not on the Canada Flixies list is a perfect example of how damn Argoed we are these days.  I will choose The Hour because it is quite good and will be over way before Lost or 24 so I can get back to re-watching BSG. Casey:   Mad Men’s the better show, but Battlestar Galactica would be better marathon watching. Even Portlandia agrees. Cory:   You are all mean, fools, or bored with life. It is Battlestar Galactica by a solar mile. The mix of high, low, and relentless drama makes me still want to bathe in the show for days on end. Yes, that means forgoing any other kind of bath. Mad Men is best in measured ounces, and Justified is too southern to have the momentum to keep you awake for days. 24 does have the momentum, but it’s exactly that meathead politics of fear (and real life outside my door) that BSG explores and critiques. Know us by our vices, Redmond (see below).  Also: Starbuck. Christopher:   Really, honestly, it has to be 24. No other show has ever – or will ever – be so perfectly engineered for marathon viewings. Jared:   House of Cards was created by a team of former  Cold War scientists in a bunker deep beneath Mount Washington,  genetically engineered from the DNA of Tony Soprano and Jimmy McNulty  for maximum watchability, trained from birth by President Jed Bartlet to  do one thing and one thing only: compel you to watch it all at once. Sincerely, The Dear Cast and Crew crew Note: Should Netflix ever acquire The Wire, it will win all the awards henceforth and therewith.  "},{"title":"Oz The Great and Powerful","url":"/2013/03/08/oz-the-great-and-powerful","date":"2013-03-08 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Michael Saunders, Second Second Assistant Director,  Just like the psychedelic social stratification in the World of Oz, with tinkers and quadlings and winkies, there’s something enchanting about the lowest levels of the film-set hierarchy: the title Second Second Assistant Director, with its alliterative rhyme scheme, sounds like a mid-level management position in the Lollipop Guild.   I’m not entirely sure what you did on the set of the quasi-prequel Oz the Great and Powerful (assisted the assistant to the Assistant Director?), but whatever contributions you made, they were towards a worthy cause—it’s a film that takes such care in cinematic world building that even the phoniest beats are saved from cracking by the sugary glaze of sincerity with which everything is painted.  To be honest, I’m unfamiliar with the Frank L. Baum books, and my relationship with the 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz – which I’m pretty sure I’ve seen one or two or ten times – has been complicated by the ensuing few decades of pop culture references and parodies. There are munchkins, I know. And a house lands on a witch. Flying monkeys too, right? Director Sam Raimi, despite the careful taxonomical ground he has to tread because of MGM’s continuing copyright on the original film and it’s most recognizable elements, displays a great deal of respect for the foundational texts—if not in the details, then certainly in the mood, which mixes its vividness and wonder with a touch of melancholy.   In the long prologue, we meet the great and powerful illusionist Oz (James Franco) as he charms his new lady assistant, berates his hype-man, gets booed offstage by angry Kansans, and is chased through the travelling carnival by a cuckolded strongman. When his balloon escape is interrupted by a tornado, he is sucked into the World of Oz. In a neat cinematic trick that echoes the 1939 film’s transition from black and white to color, the claustrophobic 4:3 frame here expands to fill the entire width of the widescreen. Mistaken for a prophetic savior (the only other option when getting sucked into a magical alternate dimension is, of course, to unknowingly be a prophetic savior), Oz assembles a team of misfits, learns some lessons about self-abnegation, and joins forces with the locals to battle a pair of wicked witches.  This is a Movie. A studio picture. A true old-fashioned Hollywood spectacle (what other type of production could afford a Second Second Assistant Director?) But Raimi’s guerilla mentality, carried over from his days in the Necronomicon-haunted forests of the Evil Dead trilogy, occasionally shows through. To Oz’s benefit, and sometimes to its detriment: his manic, swooping camera sometimes ruins the 3D effect, which is only really striking when the camera is still. There’s a suggestion of anarchy in the casting, too: the idea of James Franco carrying a colorful, kid-friendly fantasy epic from start to finish feels counterintuitive, doesn’t it? But it’s the sort of up-is-down, black-is-white backwards thinking that you find in magical realms like Oz. Turns out he’s rather perfect in the role. The cocksure young performer seeking fame at any cost, extending himself beyond his capabilities, making artistic promises he can’t keep, who reveals beneath the squinting façade an integrity and rectitude that helps him to eventually learn that goodness sometimes supersedes greatness. Surely the dick-nosed short-film auteur, fish-out-of-water Oscar host, and inauguration day poet laureate found nothing personal to draw upon. So, Second Second Assistant Director (guiding the film from can to projector!), your membership in the merry band of craftsman who worked on this film is something to be proud of. In this era of ironical, mean-spirited children’s entertainment (I’m looking at you with an arched eyebrow, Dreamworks), the earnestness of Sam Raimi’s Oz the Great and Powerful is refreshing. Like plunging from the boxed-in black-and-white world into a more tender, vivid place.   Sincerely,  Jared Young Status: Air Mail (4/5)"},{"title":"Cloudburst","url":"/2013/03/09/cloudburst","date":"2013-03-09 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Tim Webber, Craft Services It’s a well-known secret in low-budget filmmaking that if you keep the crew fed, you’ll keep them happy. The same principle applies to corporate conferences, foreign wars, and basically anywhere else people don’t want to be. Sure, some zealous upstarts will jump at any chance to get ahead, but there comes a point when, to attract proven talent, you need to offer something in return.   So what the hell kind of delicious meals did you prepare to attract Academy Award winners Olympia Dukakis and Brenda Fricker to this movie? The first meal they would have been fed, of course, was the script. Cloudburst is the story of two septuagenarian women in a closeted relationship. Stella (Olympia Dukakis) is your classic butch: a foul-mouthed, cantankerous, cowboy hat-wearing spinster. Her “roommate” of the past 31 years, Dot (Brenda Frick), is a the sweeter, more optimistic soul. Dot is also visually impaired, but, get this—it’s her daughter Molly (Kristin Booth) who is blind to the two women’s romantic relationship. The irony! So Molly tries to have her mom committed to a home and take over the family property. This leads the elderly lovers to break her out of their long-term care facility and make their way to Canada where they can legally marry. It’s actually an extremely palatable story—one that I can personally relate to, having an Aunt in a similar situation. But even though he wrote the recipe for the script (originally a stage play), director Thom Fitzgerald proves to be a huge liability behind the camera.  He seems to have no clue when to let a joke simmer, when to pull out of a scene, no flare for presentation. The multiple sunset shots are painfully overcooked with yellows, the editing is sluggish, and the film suffers from a terribly weak soundtrack. It’s a recipe for disaster, and often times is, but the two leads are so lip-smacking good that I was able to choke down the rest. In fact, I’ll give credit where credit is due. Fitzgerald manages to coax his dames into dildo fights, sermons on the word cunt, shitting into bidets, and faceplanting into bare ball-sacks. Even Judd Apatow couldn’t get an actor to do half these things. I’m pretty sure your daily menu must have included your “special” brownies and a few magic mushrooms. But, hey, whatever you have to do. You got the right actors to give the film a little zest, and now all you need is a better appetizer—the current trailer is seriously the worst I’ve ever seen.

It’s subtle, but it’s there: the center-framed shots, the self-conscious eclecticism, the tippy-toed dance on the precipice of absurdity—these are the seeds from which director Colin Treverrow has grown his first feature film. And what defines a Wes Anderson film more powerfully than its music?  So, in seeking to establish a unique sonic mood, Treverrow came to you. This is what he gave you to work with: a flick based on the feeble premise that a local magazine would send a reporter and two interns (immediately the limits of disbelief’s tensile strength are tested) to investigate a mysterious classified ad seeking recruits for a time travel adventure (in the fashion that movie magazine writers investigate their stories: snooping around, stalking their subjects, secretly staking them out, ie. the way that no magazine writers have/will ever done/do). One can debate the merits of Aubrey Plaza as a leading lady (personally, her doe-eyed monotone wore thin pretty fast, but I nonetheless understand her deadpan, zero-sum allure). One can debate, too, whether Mark Duplass’s mumblecore sincerity contributes or detracts from the aforementioned Andersonian absurdity dance. But the naked fact is this: it’s your endless selection of hyper-earnest post-grunge alt-rock, played over the opening and end credits, through every scene transition, during every quiet beat in which silence might have allowed for a moment of consideration, that really wrecked the movie’s mood for me. Anderson’s self-consciousness has purpose; it’s almost metatextual. But the way Treverrow punctuates each moment of sentiment with one of your sentimental indie tunes proves Safety to be nothing more than a cheap knock-off, a Coronet midget camera manufactured to cash in on a hipsterist craze for the quirky and different.

My mind races to guess what “special equipment” you supplied, exactly. I figure it was something shady, since it’s a well-known secret that the top suppliers in Montreal’s film industry are engaged in corrupt and monopolistic practices. But that assumption would be a blind (and possibly false) accusation, and a crime in and of itself. After watching L’affaire Dumont, that’s obviously the last thing in the world I want to do. As the follow-up to his outstanding social services drama 10 ½, director Daniel “Podz” Grou tackles the true story of Michel Dumont – a man convicted of rape and sentenced to federal prison despite an alarming lack of evidence. Quebec heartthrob Marc-André Grondin completely transforms himself into the quiet, passive, and inarticulate grocery deliveryman who suffers from a series of injustices. His mulleted mop, bushy stash and shaded glasses may scream sex offender, but the film  slowly peels away those same stereotypical judgments that put him in prison.  Granted, that fashion style should be locked away in the annals of history, and only re-supplied for important dramatic re-enactments: you’re lucky this film counts as one of those special occasions. The film goes to such lengths to reflect reality that we’re told all court dialogue used in the film is verbatim from the official transcript. This makes it especially difficult to see Dumont’s lawyer wilt every time the judge challenges the already half-hearted defense strategy.  As a result, we’re left wondering if everyone else knows something we don’t.  Dumont remains a bit of an enigma through much of the film, and his innocence is not exactly presumed, as the victim points him out in court as the man who raped her. Neither the witness nor the judge seem to take into account all the other factors that don’t fit, like missing tattoos and an entire house of people who say Dumont was with them on the night in question. But as the defense’s witnesses jumble their stories, the fact Dumont looks like a rapist (even if he’s not “the” rapist”) seems enough to seal his fate. If only he’d have shaved sooner. Once he does, director Grou risks breaking the verisimilitude by using archival footage of Dumont during a climactic moment. We then return to Grondin’s performance, and it’s a testament to the filmmakers that we never seem to break our emotional connection. It’s a bold and overt decision, but one that pays off as the encounter is too strange and unique to believe otherwise.  See, sometimes honesty goes a long way.

Actually, in the age of Kickstarter, there sort of is. If fans are willing to front the cash, they can help realize pretty much any ol’ niche project, whether it’s a graphic novel biography of Nicola Tesla, or a film giving you the closure you never got on that cult TV show you loved. And after you helped back the documentary Indie Game: The Movie, I found myself wondering if this is really what you wanted. The thing is, I think it may be; and that’s the main problem with this film. Indie Game: The Movie comes off as a labour of love made by fans for fans, and really for no one else. It hopes to be a small survey of the blood, sweat, and tears that go into developing independent games. Instead, the film is a series of missed opportunities. Co-directors Lisann Pajot and James Swirsky are more interested in portraying their subjects as martyrs—sacrificing their financial, mental and even physical well-being for the purity of gaming—rather than giving us a real understanding of the process. I realize that many mid 90s thrillers taught us that watching someone sit at a computer and code is not compelling cinema. But then again, neither is playing Donkey Kong, and yet King of Kong managed to be one of the most compelling documentaries of the last 10 years. It’s all about context. We need to know what a winning hand looks like in this world so can decode the drama when all the cards are laid down. Instead, we get a lot of complaining. Jonathan Blow, developer of indie blockbuster Braid, frets that, his game was not enjoyed by the public the way he meant it to be. Tommy Refenes and Edmund Mcmillen, co-developers of Super Meat Boy, explain the personal stresses of hitting release date (but only in terms of a financial scalability argument). Phil Fish, creator of Fez, frets over the high expectations created by early demos of his game — and the possibility that he may never meet them. This can all be affecting stuff, but for everyone but Fish (who feels his professional reputation is on the line) the stakes are never made clear – and most feel self-created. Refenes lives with a loving family that clearly supports him in success or failure. Blow’s ego seems to be driving his displeasure with the way his game is played. Even Fish’s inability to deliver on his promise is self-inflicted, as he constantly rebuilds the project from scratch. Only McMillen registers as someone with relatable issues, as we see him and his new wife both deal with the intense – and lonely – work of development (even if their goals to buy a house and a hairless cat aren’t the things of mythic storytelling). I may be simplifying the story, but I’m no more guilty than the filmmakers themselves. Indie Game: The Movie takes everything its characters say as gospel, when the real drama exists at the edges of these stories. The fact that Blow struggles with the exact same issue that has stymied artists for centuries is a natural entrance to the video-games-as-art debate. Refenes’ need to make a specific release date sure is important to him, but what is driving that date? Who are Fish’s investors, and why is he in a legal battle with his strangely mysterious ex partner? And surrounding all of this is a big, decidedly non-indie entity: Microsoft and it’s Xbox Live Arcade storefront. Each of the developers are dependent on this for the success their games. Indie Game: The Movie has no interest in this paradox. It’s a disservice to both the film’s subjects and audience not to place these smaller struggles in the larger context. Initially, I was willing to give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt, citing limited resources or time (the standard indie filmmaking problems). Then I saw the credit almost proudly stating that the filmmakers “did not attempt to contact” Fish’s partner, who is simply rendered as 2-dimentional pixilated villain. They were so committed to their subjects’ points of view that they didn’t even try to give this world another dimension. Another unintended irony, perhaps. So while the early promise may have been enough for you to invest your money, I hope the final product met your high expectations. It didn’t for me.

James Horner and James Newton Howard were my Pearl Jam and Nirvana. Hans Zimmer’s gang of synth-inspired virtuosos were my Wu-Tang Clan. I made mix-tapes that cleverly segued between the militaristic pan flutes from the opening scene of Clear and Present Danger to the theme from Con Air to Basil Poledouris’s weirdly brilliant score for the decidedly unbrilliant Under Siege 2: Dark Territory. Clearly, Trevor, you’re likewise an aficionado of action movie musicology. You must be, because the score you composed for Olympus Has Fallen relies so heavily on the tropes and devices of these old standards – from the somber horns over the opening credits to the choral hymn that plays over the final frames – that the experience is akin to time-travel. But when I say rely, perhaps I mean pay tribute to. And what I call tropes are perhaps themes. The difference in these taxonomical details is the difference between a brilliant throwback parody of pre-millennium action flicks and a misanthropic wannabe-blockbuster drowning in its own manufactured gravitas. So, let me ask you: just which one of these movies is Olympus Has Fallen? I’m guessing the first. Because there’s no way director Antoine Fuqua didn’t know what he was doing. This is satire on the level of Dr. Strangelove. This is parody executed with a verve worthy of the Zucker Brothers. All without a single note of irony that might give away the joke. Let’s set aside the eerily familiar structure of the plot (this movie is a companion piece to Die Hard in the same way that Dark Side of the Moon is a companion piece to The Wizard of Oz: built over its skeleton). Gerard Butler is certainly in on it, stalking around all John Wayne-like and growling in a breathless Batman-voice. Morgan Freeman, too, seems to be doing an impression of Morgan Freeman playing Morgan Freeman. And your music, Trevor, makes sure that this self-consciousness is never too subtle. Aaron Eckhardt, the President held-hostage, trapped by terrorists in the White House basement, can’t walk down a hallway or open a door or even blink without the horn section swelling to crescendo. How ingenious for Fuqua to construct a sequence as outrageously inhumane as the first act attack perpetrated against the people of Washington, DC (they’re gunned down by invading North Koreans in a circling jumbo jet that is inexplicably able to cruise into the capitol’s airspace), all the while keeping the action safely on the side of implausibility so that everything potentially offensive about it is merely funny. What’s brilliant about it is that people will watch this movie and totally think you guys were trying to make a real movie! But here is the best compliment I can pay you, Trevor: if I had seen this flick at the age of fourteen, I’d right now be scanning the CD racks looking for your name.

I don’t mean that in the usual way your job is defined – filling the actor’s space on set while lighting, framing and technical issues are figured out. Rather, in the sense that the film’s characters find stand-ins for what they think they want.  Even though it’s titled Admission, director Paul Weitz’s comedy is about breaking out as much as it is gaining entry. Everyone understands that your spot on set is only a temporary prelude to the arrival of the stars. Admission’s characters, on the other hand, seem to think they are already in The Show, so to speak. Portia Nathan (Tina Fey) constantly, almost desperately, tells her (very) long-term boyfriend Mark (Michael Sheen) that their life is “perfect” – she a Princeton admissions officer of 16 years, he a literature professor. Of course, in any movie where a character expounds that everything is perfect, upheaval is straight ahead. For Portia, it’s twofold: her personal life is thrown into flux when Mark leaves, while her professional identity comes into question when she meets Jeremiah (your camera-worthy counterpart, Nat Wolff), a promising-but-flawed candidate for admission who may also be the son she gave up for adoption. Both are brought to her attention by the head of Jeremiah’s alternative school, John Pressman. The fact that he’s played by a charming Paul Rudd should tip the audience off that Portia and John’s futures are intertwined. It’s not just Portia who is in stasis. Of the main cast, Jeremiah is the only one who wants to move on. Everyone else needs to realize that they may not yet have the answers to their own happiness. This might sound a little pat, a little trite, and is sort of is. But that didn’t bother me. Fey and Rudd are strong leads, and the supporting cast – including Sheen, Lily Tomlin, Wallace Shawn, Gloria Reuben – are the right choices to bring some depth to what could be a pretty fluffy piece. As a comedy, this isn’t particularly laugh out loud; it’s more ingratiating, gradually winning you over with character, similar to Weitz’s earlier film About a Boy. Although there are issues maintaining tone (which sometimes teases the gross-out the territory of another early Wietz film, American Pie) and some late reveals are telegraphed enough to not be particularly revelatory, the sheer likeability of the performances carried me through. Sure, the film is not particularly clever or original. Then again, neither is my pointing out the irony of you being the stand-in for a movie about people learning to actually stop standing still. But, to paraphrase Portia herself, if you can overlook some obvious surface flaws, you’ll find something worth investing in.

Not to mention the undoubtedly surreal experience of shooting living Hollywood legends like George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, David Lynch, David Fincher, Danny Boyle and James Cameron. So I can’t even imagine how you felt doing so with little off-the-shelf cameras like the Canon 5D and Panasonic HPX170, all while making a documentary that compares the merits of celluloid film and digital technology. Talk about bringing a knife to a gunfight. That said, I’m sure you were forgiven.  But that’s part of the problem. Save Christopher Nolan, all the aforementioned directors have gone the way of 1s and 0s. To further bolster this camp, you have Robert Rodriguez (who couldn’t stop shooting on film fast enough), Lars von Trier (who co-founded the anti-industry Dogma 95 movement) and the Wachowskis (known for pushing technological boundaries). Steven Soderbergh stands as one of the few defenders of the traditional medium – and he’s given up on filmmaking altogether. This leaves two glaring omissions in the pro-film camp: Quentin Tarantino, who recently threatened to quit if he had to shoot digitally, and Steven Spielberg, who has vowed to always shoot and cut on film (expect for, you know, the times he doesn’t). Including their voices would have added some much needed balance on the film side. Not that it matters, since digital has clearly won this war. So what is this movie really about? Interview host and producer Keanu Reeves is certainly waxing nostalgic for the original movie-making medium, and has some help pointing out the still relevant virtues of film (such as archiving).  But as the documentary tracks the improvements made by the RED One camera, the film vs. video debate that raged in the early 2000s is quickly being put to rest. The outcome might have been inevitable, but it was predictably unwelcomed by an established industry and purist enthusiasts. Side by Side is most interesting when director Christopher Kenneally simply chronicles the evolving culture. Learning about the camera controversy behind Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones or hearing how upstarts like Lena Dunham feel digital is breaking down the old boys club are both illuminating. Apart from that, this is a pretty specialized documentary that has very little relevance to the general public. Much like film formats themselves. I say all this being married to one of the most passionate and practicing defenders of celluloid film in Canada. She and I both hoped Side by Side would make a stronger case for film. Instead, it’s more like a dispassionate eulogy. Sad, but true.

Art direction.  More than stars, more than story, this attention to mood and detail is really the artistic extravagance that says: “don’t just watch me, experience me”. Of course, I’m preaching to the choir; based on your stunning work in Stoker, you’re clearly allergic to doing anything by the numbers.  It’s a shame more people involved with this project weren’t following your cues. Most of the credit for the look and feel of this film will undoubtedly be heaped on South Korean director Chan-wook Park, best known for making the wild and wonderful Oldboy (2003).  Stoker marks his much-anticipated American film debut, and it’s a strange choice. The screenplay by Wentworth Miller (the star of Prison Break and Mariah Carey videos) focuses on the return of an estranged uncle (Matthew Goode) who comes home to live with his brother’s widow (Nicole Kidman) and her just-turned-18-year-old daughter (Mia Wasikowska). The set-up is just that simple, so atmosphere helps elevate the genre and nuance the foreshadowing. It begins with a beautiful and confident minimal opening sequence that punctuates the credits with simple motion-tracking and freeze frames. This early flare opens the door for additional flourishes throughout the film, which come in the form of swooping cameras, swaying lights and playfully tricky transitions. There’s a wonderfully rhythmic pacing to many of these edits, gently increasing tension without ever allowing the film to feel like a horror film. Off-centered framing also helps to accentuate the modern-day American Gothic work you placed on the walls and within rooms, adding a sense of claustrophobia and confined beauty. The performances are also treated like an extension of your own meticulously arranged work – emoting with minimal energy and precisely occupying each new position within the frame. Kidman delivers one of her signature glassy-eyed performances, like a porcelain doll about to shatter under pressure. Goode uses his deep, soothing voice to full effect, and benefits from some subtle but effective double eye-lighting that cues us into his inner demons. And Wasikowska (looking evermore like the Millennial’s answer to Clare Danes) has a strange brand of beauty that is appropriately engaging without being titillating – even when her character masturbates in the shower (albeit to the thought of a murder). Yes, fetishization plays a pretty strong part in Stoker. From the characters’ private obsessions to your own rigorous arrangements, it’s all so very laboured and manicured. And as a static piece of art, that’s fine. But there’s a soul and purpose missing to the film. I want to remember more than just pretty images when I walk out of a theatre. Otherwise, looking good.

Get it right and it will make your career; get it wrong. you’ll ruin it.  Spring Breakers is masterfully designed to do both. The film takes a group of Disney pop stars, wrings out their innocence and runs them through a debauched teenage fantasy. The result is everything the promotional materials promise: hot girls in bright bikinis, bombastic photography, violent outbursts, and, overall, a depraved disposition. In short, it’s the easiest film in the world to market. But here’s the thing: the movie is also really freakin’ good. I’ll be honest, it’s for all the reasons you might think—and some you might not expect. ‘Cause you’re the marketing guy, what do you care? I’ll start with the obvious. If I was 13 and watched this movie for only the most salacious reasons, I would have gotten my money’s worth in the first three minutes. Writer and director Harmony Korine doesn’t waste a single frame, jumping immediately to slow-motion shots of women on the beach flashing their breasts and middle fingers to the camera. A female voiceover fantasizes half-sincerely about the virtues of Spring Break. Cut to a church group, where the not-so-subtly named Faith (Selena Gomez) symbolically raises a hand up to the Lord while the other is tucked somewhere below. Then, in a college classroom, a couple of sex-starved friends (Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson) pass notes to each other. The first reads “I want penis” written in a heart, while Hudgens mock-fellates a crudely erect drawing labeled “Spring Break Bitch!”  At this point the script probably sounds like something stolen from the offices of Brazzers.com. And it only gets better. Or worse, depending on your point of view. I can understand a few progressive feminists defending this film. For the first 20 minutes or so there’s not a male character to be found. The girls complain about how they can’t afford to go down south for Spring Break—until three of them decide to rob a diner. They aren’t manipulated by men, they take matters into their own hands. This continues throughout, as they go to parties, get naked, and tease guys about sex but refuse to go all the way. Hardly role models, but at least they’re in control. That all changes, however, after they do some coke (and who knows what else—the editing is hypnotically suggestive) and get arrested. Alien (James Franco) appears out of nowhere with his metal grills and bails them out. Franco’s performance really ties the whole film together, balancing wannabe bravado and eventual I’ve-gone-too-far-to-back-down-now realization . That’s when things really start to heat up. More guns, more sex, more neon shaded irony. Actresses don’t just trip and fall into a movie like this. At least not when they’re multiple-platform “properties” like Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens. They’re taking a big risk, hoping, perhaps, to take the Anne Hathaway career route (as opposed to Elizabeth Berkley). And that makes the film fascinating on a whole different level; we’re watching actresses as desperate to break out of their staid, conservative roles as the characters they’re playing. Everything Spring Breakers is trying to do, it does brilliantly. It’s defensible trash. It knows exactly how to give the audience what they want, and, at the same time, mock them for wanting it. Exploitation rarely raises to such heights. It’s easily the sexiest social commentary of the year. Maybe of the decade. But what it’s saying, you marketing folks probably don’t want to hear.

And while this failure doesn’t necessarily rest on your shoulders, Lisa, the prominence throughout of your archival research (expressed through a lot of grainy footage, factoids and awkward narrative impositions) is a symptom of why the movie doesn’t work.  It’s clear from the very start – before we even see a single frame – that the filmmakers are aspiring to be historically significant. The first thing we see is a series of titlecards. Long titlecards. Several sentences long. Which is too long. These titlecards explain that the aboriginal people of Australia were poorly treated by the government, and that one particularly egregious form of this mistreatment involved children being taken away from their families and put into residential schools. Awful stuff, yeah, and, totally relevant to something that happens later in the film—but that event is a matter tangential to the main narrative. When it occurs, all of this terrible factual stuff is clearly explained by the characters onscreen anyway. I’m sure the sweet story at the heart of this movie is what compelled you to be a part of making it. We have these four aboriginal soul singers in late-60s Australia overcoming the odds to be part of some sort of underground USO cabaret show. Love blooms. Lessons are learned. It’s contrived and maybe a bit too familiar, but this is a formula flick, a genre picture: an inspired-by-true-events musical biopic. There are rules to follow, I’m cool with that. To tell you the truth, at moments I was totally into it. The same way you can lose yourself in the gut-deep simplicity of a three-chord song. It’s easy, it’s expected, but that’s what’s pleasant about it. You guys had me. But then you lost me.  The film incessantly cuts away to archival footage or televised news reports conveniently demarcating where we are on the historical timeline. When the girls arrive in Vietnam, suddenly we’re looking at black-and-white 8-mm film of actual Vietnam, which makes the already sanitized story seem even more of a flimsy Hollywood façade. And bringing in footage surrounding the assassination of Martin Luther King felt like a cheap way to impose a bit of historical gravitas. All of the great historical stuff you dug up overwhelms everything fun and entertaining about the film. I’m not blaming you, Lisa. You had a job to do and you did it. But now that I’m thinking about it, The Sapphires suffers a bit from the aspirational issues that plagued Argo; like Ben Affleck’s movie, yours breaks the fourth wall, revealing, in the end credits, photos of the real-life Sapphires, along with those American Graffiti-style where-are-they-know freeze-frame summaries. Which is nice. But introducing these people into the world of the film (the same way you introduce all of these archival bits and pieces) after the ridiculous sequence in which the Vietcong attack in the middle of performance, complete with an Alfonso Cuaron-like tracking shot and blown-up bodies flying through the frame like it’s a deleted scene from Olympus Has Fallen. It’s a shame, because there were some pretty terrific moments. More genuine laughs than I expected. But also just as many diversions into awkward docudrama history lessons. And sometimes, utterly erroneous. I guarantee that there were no white soldiers in Vietnam so racists that they’d refuse to let a black doctor address their wounds. You probably knew that, too and should have let the screenwriter know. It’s a small detail, but in a movie that aspires to historical profundity, little details like that matter.

I know you almost totally by reputation, and outside of some very specific and enthusiastic audiences, it sure isn’t good. So it was hard to go into The Host with an open mind. Was it all just bad press? What was I going into? Imagine how surprised I was that the movie was not what I’d been led to believe. Clearly someone was missing something. I hope it wasn’t me. Imagine my surprise at the casting of Saoirse Ronan, who I loved in Hanna, as the mysterious young girl at the heart of a deeper mystery. You write a story that a lot of young girls would enjoy toying with. Dark forces are afoot, and she is involuntarily thrust into the middle of a conflict that has been waged for millennia. She risks the ostracism of society, family, and friends, as she struggles to find her own path. Highlighting the conflict both in the wider world and inside her own soul are two young men. Played by Max Irons and the Jake Abel (two actors who should never have to adopt an inevitably lesser but more plausible moniker for a movie role — see also Brad Pitt and The Rock) , they prod and pressure Ronan’s Melanie to choose a love and a lifestyle. Behind the scenes, the awesometown Diane Kruger (who I remember last from Inglourious Basterds) pursues Melanie with malevolent intensity, trying to just ruin everything. The ending is triumphant but open-ended, surely to serve as a strong beginning to the franchise. It’s hard to explain how the rumors and scuttlebutt had left me ill-prepared me for this movie. The story descriptions were dead-on, maybe even familiar, but all these weird missing details make me think people just weren’t paying attention. Ronan is a capable and charming actress, and nothing like the stoned sleepwalker that I was warned about. In fact, she even has red, not brunette hair. The two men she has to choose between weren’t as hunky as I expected, but again maybe that’s because I am not the target demographic. The vampire and werewolf angle, which got a lot of publicity in the news (obviously bandwagoning True Blood) is almost completely nonexistent in the movie itself. There is a bit about age-old evil beings and having to choose sides, but it’s all done in a very subtle and sci-fi way, which was interesting. The ‘shimmering’ that was joked about so much was really just Andrew Niccol’s capable direction, which at least made for a visually interesting film. That’s good, because it was a bit slow, and there wasn’t as much action as I normally expect from a monster movie.

This action/sci-fi/horror/drama phenomenon was a landmark in blockbuster cinema and continues to be just as thrilling today in 3D as it was during the original release. So how disappointing it must have been to not have your work acknowledged in the film’s final credits. Again. Luckily, as the film tells us, life finds a way. In this case, via the Internet.  So hold onto your butts, we’re about to break you out of obscurity. Natural selection, be damned!    1. Dear Ron Kunecke, Night Light Operator (uncredited)   Who could ever forget that moment when Lex (Ariana Richards) is frozen in terror, shining a flashlight into the eye of a T-Rex? Seeing those monster pupils dilate is exactly the kind of detail I know you insisted upon. Thanks to you, I’ll never operate a light at night the same again.   2. Dear Gary Rodriguez, Miner Who Dug Out Mosquito (uncredited)  Seriously, what are the odds? To find a mosquito, perfectly encapsulated in tree syrup so many miles beneath the earth. If you had swung that pickaxe a little to the left, there wouldn’t even be a Jurassic Park. If you screw up your take, who knows how they would have made those dinosaurs. God knows convincing CGI didn’t exist in ’93.   3. Dear George Burns, Car Modifier (uncredited) I’m not sure what you used as a reference point, but those poor cars never stood a chance. Chewed up by a T-Rex, pushed off the side of a cliff and slammed down prehistoric trees – the film’s most memorable moments owe you a debt of gratitude. We’re gonna need a bigger car.   4. Dear Scott Billups, Pre-Visualization (uncredited) No one could have predicted how incredible this film was going to look. Well, no one but you. Somehow you managed to convince an entire team of specialists how to do the impossible – bring dinosaurs to life in a film that would stand the test of time. But you did, and it has.   5. Dear Steven R. Kutcher, Entomologist (uncredited) Before the buzz-kill that is modern science, the idea of extracting 65-million-year-old dino DNA from a mosquito sounded perfectly plausible. In fact, this concept is so brilliantly simple (and explained so wonderfully in the park’s mid-tour cartoon) that we can completely suspend our disbelief for the rest of that film. You probably suspected DNA could never last that long, but why bug the filmmakers with actual science? It’s still a perfectly tangible concept that seems to elevate the film beyond “science fiction” and into a cautionary tale.   6. Dear Bob Corff, Voice Teacher (uncredited) Screaming kids is hardly anyone’s idea of fun. But there’s a wonderful balance in Jurassic Park of knowing when to crank up the cries for help (such as when the T-Rex attacks through the roof of the jeep), and when to simply let them breathlessly tremble (like the Jell-o scene).  Coaching pre-teens how to react both authentically and without ear-shattering annoyance is no easy task, but you did a fine job.   7. Dear Ron Mendell, Lead Model Maker (uncredited) This is one of the most obvious examples of just how old Jurassic Park is: models were still being made with lead, of all things. Maybe it was for the best that Jurassic Park paved the way towards computer graphics, since the health risks of working with lead are not worth even the most amazing—  Oh, wait—Lead Model Maker? You were the main model maker on the movie? Well, uh, good job then, because everything looked fantastic. Real or digital.   8. Dear Greg Butler, Camera Engineering Intern (uncredited)  What a time to be interning. You start a project expecting to learn cutting edge stop-motion techniques from a master like Phil Tippet, but instead wind up with a front-row seat as the entire FX industry is turned on its ear. As your subsequent Oscar-nominated career has shown, you obviously knew how to make the most of this opportunity. The student has become the teacher.     9. Dear Brian Smrz, Driver of Grant, Sattler & Malcolm’s Jeep (uncredited) I don’t know if you had the easier job, or the harder one. You’re the driver of the jeep that takes Sam Elliott, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldbloom to their first glimpse of Jurassic Park’s amazing creatures. On one hand, you didn’t have to do much reacting to the yet-unfinished effects on location, with the been-there-done-that expression you employ as the other three pretended to stare in wonder. On the other hand, you missed what might have been your only chance to make the Spielberg Face.   10. Dear John Alvin, Poster Artist (uncredited) I’m glad that IMDB exists so you can get your due credit, because dude, that poster is iconic. And beyond that, it’s almost a character itself in the movie, that logo appearing on all manner of ready-to-sell merchandise lining the park’s gift shop. It actually marks a turning point in Spielberg’s career. Coming off the disastrous Hook–a critical and commercial low point – this was an early example of Spielberg bringing some self-awareness to his films, taking a shot at the tie-in friendly filmmaking for which he was known, reflecting on the idea of art (or, in the film’s case, creation) as commerce. It’s no coincidence that 1993 began Spielberg’s second act as a more confident, self-assured artist.   Still holding on to our butts, Dear Cast and Crew"},{"title":"Evil Dead","url":"/2013/04/05/evil-dead","date":"2013-04-05 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Patrick Baxter, Prosthetics Supervisor The only thing that scares a horror director must be worrying they might not scare the audience.

Double down on the gore and kill all the comedy.  In other words, hope the bloody oozing prosthetics you created steal the show. And they did. Boy, did they ever.  I won’t name names, but a friend of mine turned to me halfway through the movie saying he couldn’t take it any more. He up and left me, alone, while I recoiled in fear and disgust as the film drove forward.  Someone had to survive to tell the tale. I’m glad I did. As a big fan of Face Off, the make-up special effects series on SyFy, I’ve acquired a new appreciation for your craft. When it’s done right, practical special effects are spectacularly effective. Your work on the new Evil Dead certainly qualifies, never letting editing or camera tricks insinuate the horror. We have to watch the whole bloody mess unfold – or should I say, dismember. My biceps hurt just thinking about it (damn you). The story, re-written by director Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues (with uncredited polishes by Diablo Cody) uses a smart hook to isolate the five actors in their haunted house. Mia (Jane Levy) is a recovering drug addict who has recruited her friends (Lou Taylor Pucci, Elizabeth Blackmore and Jesscia Lucas) and brother (Shiloh Fernandez) to help her kick the habit cold turkey. They self-impose reasons for being cut off from others, and also attribute Mia’s early misbehaviour as part of the uncomfortable recovery process. Of course, the theme of fighting your “inner demons” turns out to be more literal than they think, after a book of spells unleashes ungodly terror.  Plot wise, that’s it. What the film lacks in breaking new ground, it compensates for with crushing onscreen agony. From splitting tongues in half, to tearing off faces, to boiling live flesh, everything you’ve done in the film is textbook terrifying. The pacing is initially even-handed, even if the scares become a bit relentless in the second half. Levy’s possessed performance also creates a lot of genuine tensions and discomfort before her complete transformation (much like Jennifer Carpenter managed in The Exorcism of Emily Rose). I’m not a horror guy, but I can appreciate when a film is effective. And your work was, above all. So I’m glad I didn’t walk out, but you won’t find me walking back in to see it again.

Maybe there’s a gentler word. Geeky? Fanatical? Bored? One thing’s for sure—your geeky, fanatical boredom is continued proof that spending too much time in the Overlook Hotel is bad for the brain. As a contributing (conspiracy) theorist on Room 237, you’ve gone to the obsessive lengths of mapping out the set for The Shining in an attempt to piece together Stanley Kubrick’s puzzling horror picture. For some reason, you’re trying to prove the impossibility of certain spatial relations within the film (I’ll assume you’ve never seen a sitcom). But here’s the even crazier thing: you’re one of the more levelheaded contributors to this deep-down-the-rabbit-hole documentary. Before I begin, a couple of caveats. Even prior to getting my ornamental Bachelor’s degree in Film Studies, Stanley Kubrick has been one of my favourite directors. I‘ve always enjoyed finding deep social/political/cultural meaning in a film, and also believe that Kubrick is the worthiest of candidates for understanding the auteur theory in cinema. A movie like Room 237, dedicated entirely to both these things, sounded like a wet dream to me.  Yet there I was – for large sections of the film, anyway – truly understanding how all work and no play makes this a dull film.  Director Rodney Ascher forgoes any talking heads in favour of the disembodied voices of Shining-enthusiasts, like you. This allows the audience to spend an enormous amount of time with The Shinning, and other Kubrick films (which must account for over 95% of the footage in this documentary). The confinement to a Kubrickian diegesis (film studies!) has a hypnotic effect, allowing us to appreciate patterns and symmetry that may simply wash over the audience on casual viewings. But just as often, these narrations can be irksomely tedious when it feels like our guides are more lost in Kubrick’s labyrinth than Jack Torrance. Some readings are more convincing than others. Viewing the film as an analogy for the decimation of Native Americans or the Holocaust seems perfectly reasonable. The textual evidence may be trivial at best, but the overall conclusion is not irrational. Kubrick’s mis-en-scene was certainly not happenstance, so picking up on visual clues (Calumet Indian head cans, traditional paintings, etc.) is a worthwhile exercise. But when attention to detail becomes a wildly subjective fishing expedition (like claiming a skiing poster “sort of looks like a Minotaur”, ergo… whatever), the film starts to give film studies a bad name. The documentary’s biggest stretch, however, is also by far the most intriguing. The suggestion that Stanley Kubrick was recruited by the U.S. government to fake the original moon landing footage and subsequently coded that secret into The Shining is simply fan fiction fantasy. Sure, Danny wears an Apollo 11 sweater in the film, but everything beyond that is complete conjecture. Even the 9/11 “truther” doc Loose Change managed to make more convincing arguments. Room 237 depends on half-baked theories that literally require watching the film forwards and backwards – at the same time – to overlay meanings. The Shining certainly earns the right to be closely examined and understood, but there’s only about 45 minutes worth of proper content in this 90-minute documentary. The rest belongs locked away in chat rooms. An axe sure would have been handy for cutting things down.

Heath, Prop Paperwork, On paper, everything about 42 is great. I mean that literally. The main plot points all revolve around recreated newspaper articles, player profiles, team contracts, hand-written petitions, and hate-mail death threats. In other words, your work is really what strings together this long-overdue biopic on baseball legend Jackie Robinson. But when it comes to the film itself, the choice of textures looks a little too clean and the selected material feels a little too light. Not always, mind you, as some moments do cut unexpectedly deep. Through a series of newsreel montages, sports writer and Robinson biographer Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) explains how the returning WWII soldiers has resulted in not only a baby boom, but also a regression to pre-war segregation.  Cut to Brooklyn Dodgers executive Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) who smells a business opportunity to break the colour barrier in baseball. He just needs to find the right talented player who can take the inevitable abuse. From a pile of your carefully created player sheets, he selects Jack Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) – a former soldier court-martialed for refusing to sit at the back of a bus. The rest is history, right? Basically, yeah. Starting his career with the Montreal Royals, Robinson slowly earns the respect of his teammates by refusing to succumb to the ubiquitous taunts. More importantly, he gets under the competition’s skin by stealing bases and keeping them flustered. These sequences, along with a couple scenes when Robinson is at bat, are the film’s most effective ways of creating tension. It’s refreshing that none of these moments revolve around a big game being on the line, but are simply about exposing character’s inner hatred, whether that comes in the form of throwing racial slurs or fastballs to the head. But like many biopics in which the hero doesn’t die tragically, 42 struggles in its third act, trying to create closure – and greater meaning – out of an arguably minor milestone (qualifying for the World Series). For all the things written in Jackie Robinson’s biography, this is a strange place to end the story, even if the film mainly focuses on his rookie season. Even stranger has to be seeing Harrison Ford outside his comfort zone. Until this film, I never appreciated how much he simply leveraged personal charisma in the place of actual acting. Ford seems to be channeling John Goodman, but his Southern affectations are mannered and clunky. In the film’s quiet but serious moments, as he reacts to player petitions and written threats, your hand scribbled pages carry more weight than the actual performances. Luckily, Oscar-winning writer and director Brian Helgeland has a few visual tricks to elevate the overall film beyond being a movie-of-the-week, but the overall sum of these pieces is not greater than a few strong parts.

The very first sequence of the film is a single tracking shot that follows a tattooed Ryan Gosling through a small-town carnival, into a tent, onto a motorcycle, and eventually into a metal globe where he spins in loops alongside (and through and between) two other motorcyclists. The way you managed to set up and execute the stunt in an unbroken take is rather extraordinary—though there must have been some computer trickery involved; I can’t imagine that the insurance guys would have let Baby Goose surrender himself to the whims of centrifugal force like that.  But even more impressive than that? The structure of the stunt is no accident. What follows in Derek Cianfrance’s sprawling, ambitious, flawed (but kind of endearing) follow-up to Blue Valentine is the narrative equivalent of that stunt: the film is composed of three distinct chapters, each with three distinct protagonists, distinct arcs, each with common tensions and consequences that spin in loops alongside, through, and between each other. The whole movie feels like a complex, well-crafted stunt. But, as you surely know, a stunt is only as thrilling as the stakes that hang in the balance (ie. the death it’s defying). And that’s what The Place Beyond the Pines – a movie ostensibly about the far-reaching ramifications of a single decision – lacks thematically: ramification. Let me tell you, Brian: it’s going to be a disappointment for Gosling fangirls hoping to spend a couple of hours with their favorite monosyllabic doe-eyed mousketeer. Gosling is the star, but only for the first third of the film. The stylish rural crime flick bears striking thematic similarities to Drive (loner with a penchant for high-speed chases commits crimes to support an unavailable woman and her adorable child) abruptly gives way to a thriller about police corruption. Gosling, as protagonist, gives way to Bradley Cooper, and this, too, feels like a stunt. One of those old-school Hollywood stunts, like something from a Bond film, where at the penultimate moment (before the hero is hurled off a cliff, falls of his horse, jumps onto the hood of a moving car, etc.) we cut away from a close-up of the star and see instead, from afar, a stuntman with a passing resemblance enact the dangerous bit of athleticism. Sometimes it works. Sometimes you feel cheated; pulled out, even if for an unconscious half-second, of the immersive mood.  In this case, Cooper suffers from the sudden switcheroo. Whatever you might think of him, Ryan Gosling has a certain magnetism (particular in this type of role: the sexy and troubled man-child) and the entire second act feels ghostly by comparison. Cooper is able to muster only a small fraction of his predecessor’s likability (poor guy: he’s overshadowed, too, by a pair of spectacular supporting performances from Bruce Greenwood and a Ray Liotta). It’s like seeing a stunt driver behind the wheel during a chase scene; you try to play along, try to pretend, but you’ve lost a little faith in the steadiness of the world the filmmakers have invited us to occupy.  But, so, the sluggish second act eventually gives way to a surprising third: an angsty teen drama that begins with a revelation so rife with possibility that it almost makes up for all that glancing at your watch. But we linger with the kids a little too long (could have used a stunt or two, don’t you think: BMX jump over a swimming pool, skateboard chase?) and their precocious bouts of violence feel flimsy after the bank-robberies and chases and sinister drug-dealing cops.   For all the clever plot mechanics (it really is quite impressive how Cianfrance and co-writers Ben Coccio and Darius Marder are able to get characters into the same room with each other without stretching motivation and coincidence too far), the themes that drive them feel confused, unconsidered. Is this a movie about fatherhood? About choosing between good and evil? About atoning for your sins? Sure, it’s an incredible feat to jump a motorcycle from one ramp to another. But what matters most is what’s at stake. What’s between the ramps? A pile of mattresses or a pool full of piranhas? In this case, mattresses full of piranhas.   Sincerely,  Jared Young  Status: Standard Delivery (3/5)"},{"title":"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone","url":"/2013/04/16/the-incredible-burt-wonderstone","date":"2013-04-16 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Victoria Wood, Wig Maker Comedy rarely feels more desperate than when it revolves around a bad wig. This elementary sight gag might be able to sustain a sketch, but can quickly fall apart when stretched over a feature. It all depends on how far your actors are willing to go to sell a look. The Incredible Burt Wonderstone makes that point abundantly clear. You were covering two of the top comedic minds of the decade, but only one of them was remotely the right fit. The other felt so out of place, I’m embarrassed he ever stepped out of his dressing room. Don’t feel too bad, though. The actual wig itself was the least offensive thing about Steve Carell’s performance. As the (undeservingly) titular star of a film, Burt Wonderstone (Carell) plays a kid who grows up wanting to learn the art of illusion to magically find friends. He does  in Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi), and together they become Vegas sensations à la Siegfried and Roy. But for reasons never truly explained, Burt distains his partner and feels like he should be a one-man show. His incredible narcissism allows for some amusing bits (like a dispassionate sex encounter with Community’s Gillian Jacobs), and has the potential to be mined for a black comedy. Instead, Carrel is all over the map, and his ridiculously grandiose way of speaking and talking down to others just came across as a bad Will Ferrell impression. Refreshingly, Jim Carrey appears in the film as a Criss Angel-style extreme street performer named Steve Gray. His brand of magic is putting Burt out of business, making Burt and Anton’s show feel shallow and gimmicky. It’s a perfect parallel of the actors themselves.  Carrey comes across as the confident comedian, able to live in (and mutilate) the skin of a performance without ever breaking character. Carell, on the other hand, does a complete 180 with his performance and expects the audience to simply be fooled into thinking he’s worth redeeming. His voice changes, his attitude changes, even his hair changes – but only to expose the film’s own weaknesses as opposed to Burt’s inner vulnerability. In terms of showmanship, it’s like turning a Penn and Teller show into a stage reading of The Magician’s Handbook. Are you noticing how dated all these references are? I can’t help but feel this script has been sitting on a shelf somewhere since the 90s. The style of humour is as out-of-touch as your hair pieces, but without the knowing nod. I realized the film was in trouble once Olivia Wilde, as an interchangeable stage assistant, earned the most genuine laughs just while being tossed around backstage. If the filmmakers would have stuck with that basic magic principle of loud distractions up front (like your hair) being at the service of subtle but impressive workmanship behind-the-scenes, this movie would have stood a fighting chance. Instead, one loud and distracting performance (without any help at the screenplay level) just turns the whole production into amateur hour.

In fact, the opening fifteen minutes, which features a lot of expository voice-over, beautiful vistas, and flawlessly upholstered midcentury modern furniture, is reminiscent of the first few minutes of Strange Brew, in which Bob and Doug McKenzie describe, in expository voice-over, how mutants have taken over the planet in 2051 A.D.  This isn’t to say Oblivion is uninteresting. There’s something pleasing about the nakedness of its world-building aspirations—and about the strangely antiquated approach to the sci-fi genre (it feels like a very pretentious and expensive episode of the Twilight Zone). But even though it boasts breathtaking photography, peerless production design, and an enjoyable Vangelis-y score by French electro band M83, there’s something frustrating about just how lacking in self-awareness the film is. Tom Cruise plays the aforementioned square-jawed hero (with the square-jawed, heroic name Jack Harper), who, after his long days cruising the radioactive wastelands, comes home to a sleek condo apartment in the sky where his sexy British secretary swims around naked and makes him coffee (wrote the teenage boy one lonely Friday night). These living quarters are perched at the top of a space needle, and are an interior design enthusiast’s wet dream. Here Oblivion proves itself less an heir to the works of Ray Bradbury and Philip K. Dick and more an entirely new genre of speculative fiction: survival fantasy for devotees of Charles and Ray Eames, a summer blockbuster for aficionados of Mies van der Rohe.  The attention paid to the prop, costume, and set design is really something to behold (and IMAX really is the way to behold it). If only the events that occurred within that world were so elegant and meticulously calculated.  This flick belongs entirely to the art department. Particularly to the craftsman like you, who clearly put considerable effort into giving depth, texture, and meaning to the space. It certainly doesn’t belong to Joseph Kosinski and his team of screenwriters. While you obviously took great care to give the chairs and divans of the future some sense of shared history and evolutionary logic, the story falls back, time and time again, on tired tropes and action movie clichés. I was constantly waiting for a wink to the camera, an acknowledgement that it was all a joke. Oblivion is the sum of its details. While the noise and bluster and relentless musical score press forward, the real joy of this movie is to watch what’s happening in the background—to admire the clever conceit of Tom Cruise’s bubbleship, which is so much more interesting sitting immobile on a launch pad than it is chasing probe droids through caves and canyons.  Later in the film, Jack Harper meets up with a svelte, full-lipped Eastern European castaway (scribbled the teenage boy later that lonely night), and brings her home to his sky-pad. One almost wishes Kosinksi had chosen to linger more on that domestic drama just so we could spend more time in the lovely minimalist living room with the dreamy, comfortable-looking couch.  Because the couch is really the star of the film.  Sincerely,  Jared Young Status: Standard Delivery (2.5/5) "},{"title":"Still Mine","url":"/2013/04/19/still-mine","date":"2013-04-19 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Richard Pryce, Genny Operator This “genny” you were operating – it was a generator, and not the lovable 71-year-old Geneviève Bujold, right? Or maybe it was both. After all, getting enough power to a film set is a major challenge when shooting in remote locations. Especially when you need to keep your septuagenarian stars energized and comfortable. But some projects are worth the extra effort, and Still Mine, the true story about a stubborn rural farmer in New Brunswick, certainly qualifies. Your team went off the grid and outside the studio system to create something small and intimate, but which is also solid and beautiful. Like this story proves, sometimes that’s the only way to realize a labour of love. Still Mine could be considered the third installment of writer and director Michael McGowan’s unofficial “end of life” trilogy. In both Saint Ralph (2004) and One Week (2008), his characters set single-minded goals to rediscover hope in the face of fragile mortality. Here we follow Craig Morrison (James Cromwell) as he attempts to build a small house for his ailing wife Irene (Geneviève Bujold) on their expansive property.  It’s a simple and noble quest, needlessly complicated by a constant wall of bureaucratic red tape and legal nitpicking – the most unwelcome and unnecessary kinds of power. The film opens with a court proceeding threatening Mr. Morrison with jail-time for violating 26 building codes. I was more than a little curious what kind of dilapidated shack this old coot must have thrown together. Surely there wouldn’t be any electricity and the walls must be caving in on the joint. But my curiosity would have to wait, as the film cuts back to two years earlier in the couple’s original quaint country home. It’s actually here where heat and power are in short supply, as the toilets freeze in the winter and a refrigerated truck for their strawberry crop in the summer is a luxury that’s out of the question.  Still, they enjoy a nice life and passionate romance until Irene starts to lose her memory. After suffering a few falls, Craig vows to build them a single-storey home with a proper view of the bay. As an old-fashion handy man, he insists on doing the majority work himself and on the fly (blueprints are for sissies… ie, government inspectors). So when the work stoppage orders start getting serious, it’s not only threatening the couple’s future but Craig’s personal identity. This is all handled with a restrained dignity that never gets played for cheap laughs or overwrought drama. Everything from the performances to the direction is handled much like the design of the house itself – modest but honourable, and genuinely well-made. It’s surprisingly powerful stuff. Congrats.

He’s a notorious recluse who spends years shooting each project, refuses to commit to a script, and disposes of entire star performances—all as a matter of standard practice. And yet, people clamor for the opportunity to work with him (even if a few are left bitter about the experience). Maybe it’s because Malick is less obsessed with perfection than he is with process. What other filmmaker would require three “humanity unit” consultants, an “ambassador of goodwill,” and 51 undefined interns? No wonder critics find it so hard to separate the making of the film from the final cut. But with you’re help, Tyler, I’m going to try. To The Wonder features Olga Kurylenko, prominently and proudly, as its voice, heart, and soul. Her character lives in France with a young daughter and struggles to find her place in the world while hoping her American boyfriend (Ben Affleck) will make a serious commitment. They eventually move to a suburb in the U.S., and cross paths with a Spanish priest (Javier Bardem) who is having his own existential crisis.  That’s a top-level narrative synopsis; Rachel McAdams also appears for about ten minutes as an ex-girlfriend, and Rachel Weisz, Amanda Peet, Barry Pepper, Jessica Chastain and Michael Sheen can apparently be found on the cutting room floor. But, wait, sorry. Let’s not go there. Let’s focus on art. Malick is a naturalist filmmaker whose passion for the planet is a deep part of all of his work. More and more, his camera seems to lose interest with human characters in favor of shimmering bodies of water, majestic trees, beautiful sunsets, etc. In that sense, To The Wonder might be the most Malickian film he’s ever made — times ten. A lot of his decisions feel like clichéd artistic indulgences: soft foreign language voiceovers waxing poetic about love, constant shots of grass blowing in the wind (a Malick favorite), or a beautiful woman twirling through wheat fields, empty homes and Parisian streets. The film is radically close to being emotional porn. But for those who buy in – and I did – it all adds up to a richly rewarding experience. It’s not as expansive as The Tree of Life, or as evocative as A New World, or accessible as Badlands—yet To The Wonder is the purest example of Malick’s love affair with free-form filmmaking. If we don’t worry about what he removed (be it potential actors, plot or meaning), there’s still a lot left here to love. For that reason, I have no idea which aspects of the film you contributed to. In fact, you and the other collaborators might feel the same way. But for artists and audience members who are willing to be lost at the service of something beautiful, that’s okay.

And I have a feeling that this truth is relevant even to the less glamorous jobs on set. Though I suspect that set dressing occupies a place of importance when Bay is in the director’s chair; his films are primarily interested in trying to show the world in the coolest, sexiest, most epic way possible. In a sense, everything in a Michael Bay film is set dressing: cars, helicopters, Megan Fox. Pain & Gain is shot with the same low-angle, high-saturation awe with which Bay seeks to give every character a god-like glow. It still loses its focus in scenes that fetishize luxury (placing more importance on your set dressings than the story), and it’s still guided by the same homophobic, misogynistic, bro-centric vision that made films like Bad Boys, Armageddon, and The Rock so risible. However, because Pain & Gain is the story of incompetent kidnapping and accidental murder set in Miami’s bodybuilding subculture, Bay has found the perfect place to indulge in these aesthetics. It’s a place where his particular brand of objectification makes complete sense. Sure, as in his previous films these characters are treated and photographed as objects of desire; but the thing is, these characters would love that. Mark Wahlberg, playing personal trainer Daniel Lugo, often speaks of the American Dream he thinks he’s owed, even quoting a tenet of the I-deserve-it-all ethos of The Secret: “If you deserve it, the universe will serve it.” He’s talking, really, about all the ostentation with which you populate Bay’s sets. In Lugo’s all-or-nothing view, everything and everyone who impedes his march is disposable, objects to be tossed aside in pursuit of his dream. He wants the oceanside house, the Miami Vice-style cigar boat, the Porsche and the Lamborghini. He wants to live in a Michael Bay film. Could Michael Bay possess this much  self-awareness? Did you detect a master plan when dressing sets that are almost a parody of the American consumer ideal? More importantly, does it matter? Even if this self-criticism is unintentional, it’s there on the screen. The three main characters are physical embodiments of Bay’s bigger-is-better approach to…well, everything. This physicality also reflects the high costs of such a lifestyle: the mutation of self-image; literal impotence. That this all comes through in sly, affecting performances by Wahlberg, Anthony Mackie, and especially Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, just added to my disorientation. Not that everything works on this meta level. Pain & Gain is still overstuffed. It  runs a bloated 130 minutes, padded out by overindulgent slow motion, freeze frames, and other Bayian (I’m trademarking that adjective) flourishes. But maybe that’s the point. Maybe the filmmaking is a criticism of itself. In Pain & Gain’s world, you either go all in or you go home. And the film itself – the style, the length, the overindulgence, and, yes, even the set dressing – follow suit in order to maintain some sense of thematic integrity. And, at this point in his career, a little honesty from Michael bay feels like progress.

Always missing the chance to make a buck. Today, you (or we, the Canadian people) are investing in the nation’s naughty business, then selling it back to the public (or ourselves, the Canadian people).Federal tax credits keep the film industry afloat and taxpayers agree to fund cultural agencies such as Telefilm, who, in turn, invest in movies like My Awkward Sexual Adventure. It’s a funny system to be sure, one which has raised more than a few voices in the House of Commons (Bubbles Galore and Young People Fucking spring to mind).  But the policy continues, panning for cinematic cultural gold that will enrich our lives. Well, this film might not be it, but it’s certainly not a complete write-off either. Winnipeg director Sean Garrity trades in his typically quiet and introspective filmmaking style in order to bring this out-and-out comedy to the screen. He has, however re-teamed with his usual collaborator Jonas Chernick, who wrote, produced, and stars in the film. Safe to assume this type of creative consistency won their funding application a few points, but the bankable, formulaic script (and provocative title) probably helped, too. Chernick plays Jordan Abrams as the quintessential Canadian loser-hero: a louse in the sack who can’t satisfy his sex-starved girlfriend. Proposing to her only makes things worse, until a trip to Toronto gives him an opportunity to discover his mojo. After some occasionally amusing hijinks, Jordan meets your classic stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold, Julia (Emily Hampshire), and the two make a deal to exchange accounting tips for sex tricks. Boy will proceed to get girl/lose girl a few more times before the whole thing arrives to a predictable, but delayed, climax. But like I said earlier, my goal is not to add to the moaning and groaning of culture-cutters complaining that the government is propping up Hollywood North. I actually found the film well done and a worthy investment of my time. And my money. Chernick and Hampshire manage a distinct chemistry, which keeps the rom-com antics grounded.

This sort of quick recognition is pretty impressive, considering you’ve only directed one other movie (the self-referential neo-noir flick Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Impressive, too, that you managed to retain a bit of your idiosyncratic style in what is perhaps the most constraining situation imaginable: a studio-financed franchise worth mega-millions. What’s most astounding, however, is how you managed to turn the third chapter in one of the most popular modern comic book adaptations into another loving ode to film noir. Kiss Kiss was the beginning of Robert Downey Jr.’s Hollywood redemption tour (his character Harry Lockhart was Tony Stark with training wheels; all the charm and ego, none of the money), and it’s a wonderful bit of kismet that you guys are reunited, here, with the vast resources of Marvel Studios and Paramount Pictures behind you.  So, how do you indulge? You keep Tony Stark outside the Iron Man armor for most of the movie, treating him instead like an good noir foil: a man betrayed by his own hubris, whose greed and misanthropy come back to bite him in the ass. After a series of attacks wrought by Ben Kingsley’s implacable super-terrorist The Mandarin, Stark follows clues like a good private dick, escaping from trouble not through the use of brute force, but rather by a bullet-headed persistence and a good deal of blind luck.  The noir hero is rarely invincible or infallible; the private eyes and aging boxers and struggling conmen who populate the genre are hardly ever in control, and neither, in this film, is Tony Stark. He’s struggling with post-traumatic stress after the interdimensional shenanigans in the last act of The Avengers, and suffers constant anxiety attacks that threaten his most precious resource: his ego. It’s difficult in a movie beholden to the rhythms of a modern Hollwyood blockbuster to earn a genuine surprise; we’re all so familiar with the conventions that even when they’re broken it feels expected. However, the turn that the plot takes with The Mandarin feels genuinely refreshing (and finding something refreshing within genre orthodoxy is kind of your specialty: more proof that this is, through and through, a Shane Black joint). The secret of the Iron Man movies has been that they’ve managed to avoid the crippling self-seriousness that drags so many current comic book adaptations to the bottom of the ol’ Nietzschian muddy waters (I’m looking at you, Amazing Spider-Man). And that’s why you were such an obvious choice to make this movie. You may not have invented the action-comedy, but you were certainly a founding father of its tropes and traditions. Lethal Weapon may have aged poorly, but that’s only because it’s the foundational text from which the prevailing common language has sprung. But here we are talking semantics and thematics. A Shane Black movie, above all else, is entertainment. And Iron Man 3 is nothing if not entertaining (says the guy who has trouble remaining objective). And not simply entertaining in the traditional manner of CGI-fueled summer popcorn fare. The way you confound expectations by setting up heroic moments for Stark and then letting them sputter to a stop feels subversive, somehow, and even though we get the whiz-bang finale where the hero and villain (Guy Pearce going full Alan Rickman) find themselves face-to-face and fist-to-fist atop a tower, the self-awareness that runs beneath it (“Here we are, on the roof,” Pearce says) makes it feel like it’s all on purpose. And though film noir is defined by a moral ambiguity and bleakness which Iron Man 3 certainly lacks, it is always driven forward, as the gears turn and the latches click into place, by a sense of inevitability, a feeling, indeed, that it’s all happening on purpose. And that, I think, is where much of the joy of a Shane Black movie comes from.

Sorry, I mean Mr. Carter. Ugh, that doesn’t feel right. Your stage name commands more respect than standard honorifics in today’s superficial, celebrity-obsessed world. Why shouldn’t it? You’re a self-made man. A party magnet (and magnate) who built a fortune under an assumed name while living the American dream. You’re a modern day Jay Gatsby if ever there was one. It’s only fitting that someone with your contemporary sensibilities was involved with bringing to the screen F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic cautionary tale of riches, recklessness, and youth. Like most Baz Luhrmann films, it begins with the soundtrack. In Strictly Ballroom, Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge (dubbed his “red curtain” trilogy) the pop score doesn’t just set a tone, it’s a fully-developed character in the film. The lyrics supplement the narration, while the music propels the imagery. Few films would ever look so jumbled on mute. The Great Gatsby is no different, and you’ve helped Lurhmann build a bridge back in time by helping him incorporate the music of some of today’s most popular and acclaimed artists. And, wow, the 1920s have never been so roaring. Aspiring writer and bonds salesman Nick Carraway (Tobey McGuire) buys a small house next to the mansion of mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). All of New York City seems to gather for Gatsby’s lavish and extravagant weekend parties, which we soon discover are simply an attempt to impress a girl he once knew and loved (Carey Mulligan). She’s now married to an aristocratic who lives across the bay (Joel Edgerton). It’s a white, white world with #FirstWorldProblems, but essentially Gatsby is straight-up gangsta and trying to pimp his way into a bitch’s heart.  You feel me? Eye-popping, in-your-face visuals are also Luhrmann’s trademark, and in 3D the effect is doubled. A bit overkill, no doubt —but, then again, this is a film all about excess. The story takes place in 1922, when illegal speakeasies helped spark the underground jazz scene; the music was chaotic, spontaneous, and celebratory, and perfectly captured the rebellious spirit of the times. You’ve replaced most of that with hip hop here, which is the musical heir apparent to that movement. But like Gatsby himself, you had your artists reinterpret the success of others. Emeli Sandé covers Beyoncé. Beyoncé covers Amy Winehouse. You do an original song, but I’m sure Beyoncé got in there somehow. The best contribution is Jack White’s incredible take on U2’s Love is Blindess; he transforms it from an airy and meandering B-side to a blistering, emotional rock ballad. This is the true sprit of Gatsby: seizing on the missed opportunities of others. In that spirit, this film and its soundtrack are a success. They give us all the luxury and opulence we expect, but, unfortunately,  at the service of exposing the futility of those all-American ideals. Much like Spring Breakers or Pain & Gain of the past few months. Just with better music. Sure, this movie’s got problems, but a bitchin’ soundtrack ain’t one. Peace out, Christopher Status: Air Mail (3.5/5)"},{"title":"Aftershock","url":"/2013/05/14/aftershock","date":"2013-05-14 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Contanza Garcia, Make-up and Tattoo Artist, I’m guessing you’ve never seen that HBSC “Your Point of View” campaign. You know, the one where images of, say, tattoos and henna, swap headlines like “Trendy” and “Traditional”? It’s rather brilliant, reminding us that culture, preference and personal experience has an ability to challenge stereotypes. Not even a modicum of that nuance has made it way into Aftershock. Everyone you’ve given a tattoo is instantly – and lethally – labeled “Slut” or “Rapist”. But that’s just the beginning of the clichés in an earthquake movie that sure has a hard time shaking things up. It begins with the characters – or should I say caricatures. Set in Chile, we have “Gringo” (Eli Roth), a white American traveler who doesn’t speak Spanish. Then there’s “Pollo” (Nicolás Martínez), which is Spanish for “chicken”, so naturally he spends most of his time running around scared with his head – actually, hand – cut off. There’s also Irina (Natasha Yarovenko) a Russian model who simply has to look the part, Ariel (Ariel Levy) a fat, loud-mouth womanizer who fit the bill so well they didn’t bother to change the actor’s name, a good girl short-haired sister (Andrea Osvàrt), bad girl long-haired sister (Lorenza Izzo), and a laundry list of others like “Firefighter”, “Priest” and “Grumpy Operator” – each of which is given a rather significant moment in the film. Significant, of course, in that predetermined one-dimensional sort of way. Even Selena Gomez a gives a completely useless “special appearance” in the film, playing a stuck-up snob in a club credited as “V.I.P. Girl”. Another ground breaking character choice, I know. So after meandering between wine tasting tours and dance clubs, the story finally finds a pulse when the earthquake hits. We know this is happening because the camera shakes a whole lot and people run around waving their arms in the air. The set pieces start falling and crushing people, sometimes to both shocking and hilarious effect. Initially, I was teased into thinking the film may be taking these cues from the Final Destination series (a personal favorite), but instead it strangely side-steps into a simple horror story about running away from escaped prisoners with nothing but rape on the mind. Identified, of course, by simply having tattoos. The film is not without its fun surprises, namely the ability to discard its characters with the same carelessness they were thought up. And being made with a measly budget of $2 million, I’m more inclined to applaud some of the camera tricks than I am to point out the obvious cheats. But at the end of the day, this is a movie that will barely register on the Richter scale of disaster films. Saving myself, Christopher Status: Return to Sender (2/5) P.S. On the plus side, this film made me appreciate that Australian tsunami-plus-killer-shark B-movie Bait even more.

You wrote a story about a writer, who writes about a fictional dream girl that magically comes to life. You were then cast as said girl (Ruby Sparks) and brought her to life on screen, yourself. There’s two ways to look at this. One, you just cleverly wrote a dream part for yourself to play, and then did. Or two, this film is not just thematically, but literally, the manifestation of a meta-physical crisis whereby your unrealistic, self-absorbed standards of perfection have come to life in order to teach you a lesson.   To be honest, both possibilities only deepen my affection for this perfectly charming indie film. But after seeing your name all over the closing credits, I can’t help but add my own narrative. So you, Zoe the writer (and granddaughter of legendary director Elia Kazan), write a screenplay called Ruby Sparks that centers around a young prodigal male authour named Calvin Weird-Fields, played by your real-life boyfriend Paul Dano. Calvin is a loner who dreams of meeting a girl that fills all his fantasies of what a girl should be – cute, quirky, completely affectionate and unwaveringly loyal. But since you are the original author, these are either your own self-projections, your own desires, or just your interpretation of the male fantasy. Either way, you suddenly appear as Ruby Sparks, and embody them all. Which, at least initially, seems to be a dream come true for everyone involved – fictional and real. Especially Calvin, who has absolute power over Ruby. She immediately becomes exactly what he writes, even though he initially vows to never tinker with his original design. But who can resist, right? This probably parallels your own power as the film’s screenwriter on set (and executive producer), able to tweak dialogue to suit the given mood. That seems to serve you well, as the character exchanges feel authentic and unhampered by heavy exposition. But like Calvin, you were probably kept in-check by forces around you, such as real-life couple Valerie Fairs and Jonathan Dayton, directing their follow-up feature to Little Miss Sunshine. Their ability to delicately balance the comedy and drama shines through, helping the film avoid the hammy territory of The Odd Life of Timothy Green, while keeping your story more accessible than it’s obvious inspiration, Adaptation. The film is actually at its best when it starts deviating from expectations. Going to some dark places helps the story avoid the potential pitfall of being just a romantic comedy with a twist, and elevates the whole experience to the rather profound. But that’s just for the audience. For you, it was actually life changing.  Sincerely, Christopher Status: Air Mail (4/5)"},{"title":"Star Trek Into Darkness","url":"/2013/05/16/star-trek-into-darkness","date":"2013-05-16 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Fritz Beck, Lighting Artist, I hope you appreciate the irony – or should I say, “highly illogical” nature – of putting so many blindingly bright lens flares in a “dark” movie. Yes, I know those red, white and blue streaks are director J.J. Abrams’s visual trademark. I also realize that even though the latest Star Trek movie professes to go “into darkness,” that the movie still upholds the summer blockbuster obligation to be light and fun. Both in form and content. Still, I have to pick on you a little. Because this movie is stunning to look at, riveting to sit through and an overall joy to watch, despite its occasional indulgence in clichés and disobedience of the franchise’s own Prime Directives. The second installment of the refreshed NCC-1701 Electric Light Orchestra opens to Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Dr. “Bones” McCoy running away, Indian Jones-style, from natives on an exotic planet. Immediately, the film bursts with energy, humour, danger and moral philosophizing. Even when the pace slows to deal with the consequences of that opening sequence, the film packs a surprising amount of story propulsion and relationship development. The script does a fantastic job of giving every character their moment to shine. Far too often, you just had to “complement” this with an actual spotlight, beaming into the frame. Even the film’s central villain, revealed as Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch), is not immune from this heavenly light. His overall impact, however, feels strangely overshadowed as the story progresses. It’s also a bizarrely similar reflection to the plot of Iron Man 3, with modified government super soldiers gone rogue and on a similarly unconvincingly rendered mission. This is small complaint, however, since Cumberbatch commands a truly menacing presence with his deep baritone voice, intellect and imposing stature. At the other end of the spectrum, Pine proves to be more than capable of bringing much needed dimension to the Captain, while Spock (Zachary Quinto) continues to provide a perfect foil and even alternate lead. My only real complaint is I never truly believed in the darkness that the film promises. The second entry in a series provides the ultimate opportunity for throwing  established heroes into a deep dark pit of despair where their survival and moral code are called into question (The Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2, etc). Star Trek Into Darkness certainly aims in this direction, but stops short of really diving into the abyss. It’s not just your optical additions that undermine that, or the way most of the crew’s “outs” are always telegraphed to the audience a few scenes before they’re revealed. You never doubt that there’s light at the end of the tunnel. That said, I still feel this is an immensely enjoyable film that has to be the best-looking big-screen space adventure I’ve ever seen. It even got me very excited about how J.J. Abrahams will treat his upcoming Star Wars films. Because hey, maybe you guys know something I don’t about how lighting effects actually look in space. Because - help me out - is Commander Chris Hadfield’s Space Oddity video art imitating life, or vice versa?  Beaming out, Christopher Status: Air Mail (4/5)"},{"title":"The Hangover Part 3","url":"/2013/05/24/the-hangover-part-3","date":"2013-05-24 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Bryant Powell, Stand-In for Zach Galifiankis,  Tell me the truth, Bryant. It’s all a joke, isn’t it? An expensive, elaborate inside joke. A hilarious showbiz prank. A 60-million dollar episode of Between Two Ferns.  You must know. You were on set with Zach with all the time. I mean, not right beside him or anything—but even in those brief moments while you were swapping places, after the marks were set and the lights were ready, something of his motivations must have been revealed. A knowing wink? A clandestine nod? Some sort of dismissive wanking motion?   That’s the magic of Galifianakis’ act: one never quite knows whether the joke is for you or if it’s on you.  And that’s a problem, Bryant, because The Hangover Part 3 belongs entirely to Galifiankis and Ken Jeong. The rest of the cast seems to be fulfilling their contractual obligations—and who can blame them? Bradley Cooper has shrugged off the endearing douchebaggery that launched his career (in Wedding Crashers and the original Hangover) in favor of embracing his new status as doe-eyed, Oscar-nominated leading man. Ed Helms seems content to explore more complex versions of his nebbish dentist character in flicks like Cedar Rapids and Jeff Who Lives At Home  While the first two Hangover films relied heavily on a somewhat unique dramatic structure (we never saw the balls-tripping bender that incited the action, only the aftermath), this last chapter, to its detriment, breaks from the formula. Instead we get John Goodman as a Vegas crime boss who kidnaps unlucky Doug (Justin Bartha’s absence is at least consistent) to compel the rest of the Wolf Pack to find and capture master criminal Chow (Jeong). Which they do, eventually, in a series of complicated set-pieces that never really seem to go anywhere.    The first Hangover suffered a bit from the same kind of scene-to-scene lack of payoff, but it nonetheless felt a bit special, a bit distinct; Galifiankis, in particular, who brought such an unsettling, endearing weirdness to his character, like he had something to prove to mainstream audiences about what to expect from the funny man in a comedy ensemble. But the third time around it all feels a bit tired. And I get the impression that Galifianakis knows it. Which is why you have to tell me, Bryant: is that palpable sense of lethargy and laziness, of going through the motions—is it some sort of clever meta-commentary on the Hollywood recycling system? Does Zach Galifianakis know how lame The Hangover Part 3 is? And is he making it lame on purpose?

Chan, Action Sequence Designer, CRASH! BANG! ZOOM! In a Fast and Furious world, this is the code to live by. And God love it. What more do you need, right? After being an effects artist on Fast & Furious (part 4 – the de facto franchise reboot) you were promoted to the ‘drill sergeant of danger’ on Fast 5 – a film where your incredibly staged action sequences took the series to another level. Now you’ve done it again, this time turning the characters into full-on death-defying superheroes. But something else has changed. A fourth word has been added to the series manifesto in this sixth film, spoken no less than two dozen times (I lost count). Say it with me: Family.  Sorry… FAMILY! “But why?” you must have asked. “I’ve got races on mountain cliffs, London streets, freeway bridges and airline tarmacs. And an army tank, dammit!” Yes you do, and frankly, they are used to rather spectacular effect. Locking your action on a narrow plain proves a pure and simple principle: anticipation is just as important as surprise. Think Speed or The French Connection. Unlike the mess of modern action movies, where shaky cameras and frenetic editing try to save sloppy sequencing, Fast & Furious 6 is serviced with silky smooth cinematography so we can actually see what’s happening. In return, we appreciate the surprises.  So after six films, I guess you should have seen this coming – it’s not just about the cars anymore, it’s about FAMILY. That’s right, in a series defined by alternating characters, rotating roles and confusing titles (this film is actually called Furious 6 in the opening credits), all the pieces from the past have assembled (Assemble!) for this big reunion – Vin Disel, Paul Walker, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Tyrese Gibson, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot and Dyawne “The Rock” Johnson – in addition to some new blood. Even the once-dead Michelle Rodriguez is resurrected, without her memory, in that classic comic book way. As for character names, they’re forgettable and irrelevant. What matters is that we care about the faces behind the wheel. This time, we’re following the band of now multi-millionaire criminals doing a job for the Law, but always for “family” reasons. And by telling us how much they care about each other ad nauseum, the feeling can’t help but rub off on us a bit. I might have a hard time telling the films a part, but at least I could appreciate the emotional consequences to your action scenes. See, unlike almost every other franchise, ever, Fast and Furious is actually getting better with age. In some ways, it’s like a customized car that keeps getting louder, faster and more ridiculous looking. But the series is now convincingly revving its engines against the biggest blockbusters out there. It has Mission: Impossible gadgets, James Bond babes and demographic crossover appeal. Even with all the muscle heads and lug nuts, this film finds a way to balance every gratuitous bikini ass shot with a kick-ass female action scene (welcoming Mixed Martial Arts queen Gina Carano to the family helps). Because of you—and by proving that Fast 5 wasn’t a fluke—we no longer have to be embarrassed about liking this franchise. And after that closing credits tease, count me as one of the people who thinks the seventh film can’t come fast enough.

Fab-u-lous. A stage diva of the highest order; an incredibly gifted pianist, an absurdly lavish dresser, and a proudly flamboyant performer. For a period, he was also the world’s highest paid entertainer. But like the subjects of all great American tragedies, that wasn’t enough. He was missing something. A lover. A friend. A son. All of which he found in Scott Thornson – a simple Massachusetts’s animal lover who became the “best boy” to the brightest lightshow in the Vegas. You know what I’m talking about.  To the outside world, “best boy” is a pretty funny title. Not unlike the “best man” at a wedding, the description of “best” is actually second to one other. In your case, it’s the second-in-command of the lighting department, the person in charge of coordinating people and schedules. A similar relationship, in some ways, that Scott has with Liberace. And for both of you, I imagine it’s sometimes hard never being in the spotlight – especially when you’re always so close to the stage. Matt Damon, looking more boyish at age 42 than he ever has, plays the doe-eyed Scott who meets Liberace (a fab-u-lous Michael Douglas) backstage at a Vegas show in 1977. From there, an unconventional relationship blossoms outside the prying eyes of a deeply homophobic world. They’re also contending with a major age difference, and a confusing professional relationship – Scott being bisexual and Liberace being sexually demanding. But the actors do a great job of stripping away the extravagance and focusing on the simple, relatable experience of people initially swooning over one another and then growing apart. Just with a lot more drugs and plastic surgery. This is a film that Hollywood studios believed couldn’t find a theatrical audience and was therefore produced for television by HBO, after premiering at Cannes. Such a grand stage seems befitting of the man who inspired the film, I’m sure you’d agree. Even if Steven Soderberg’s staid direction never indulges in all of the lightshow around the candelabra the way I’m sure you would have liked.  Instead he’s more interested in the shadows and quiet nooks of the story. Was it the best approach? Maybe not, but then again, that depends on your definition of best.  Sincerely, Christopher Status: Air Mail (3.5/5)"},{"title":"Now You See Me","url":"/2013/05/31/now-you-see-me","date":"2013-05-31 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear David Kwong, Head Magic Consultant, When people marvel at movie magic, it’s not usually card tricks caught on film. But that’s exactly what we get in the very first scene of Now You See Me: a point-of-view illusion. The audience is told to pick a card from a shuffling deck, and, moments later, a card lights up a skyscraper in the background. Sure enough, it was the card I had committed to memory (along, I suppose, with 90% of the audience). This impressive feat that you helped to orchestrate was a perfect hook, even if, afterwards, all the other illusions suffer predictably from…well, the standard movie magic. But who cares. Now You See Me is definitely a fun movie. It’s fast, witty, slick, and satisfying. The script takes as much pride in revealing secrets as it does in trying to trick the audience, and that’s exactly what makes spectacle work on the big screen—and the Vegas stage. Just ask David Copperfield, the man whose magic (according to the closing credits) “inspired” the film. Your role, David, was therefore probably much like Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) in the film: a former magician who makes a living selling trade secrets. Thaddeus is recruited by mystified FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) when The Four Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Ilsa Fisher, and Dave Franco) shower an audience with three million Euros stolen from a French bank during one of their shows. They welcome the publicity that accompanies their subsequent arrest, with Eisenberg’s character proclaiming that if the process goes any further, the FBI will essentially be forced to “believe in magic at an institutional level”.  And so they’re set free, while Thaddeus proceeds to unravel their elaborate crime (albeit without the required proof). And soon we’re on to the next show, which is much less mystical, but rife with consequence. Once again, as quickly as the process of their deception is revealed, the story is a few steps ahead in setting up the third and final climactic trick. The pacing and quick character introductions do an effective job of drawing us in as the film unfolds. Of course, like all good magic, much of it is misdirection.  Being shown “how” something happened certainly satisfies our immediate curiosity, but this puzzle-piecing is also done at the determent of developing our central characters. The individual skill sets of The Four Horsemen (mentalism, slight-of-hand, theatrical illusions, street magic) and their relationship to one another is overshadowed by a police pursuit midway through the film. But by the end we understand that even this seemingly devaluating approach is foregrounded by design. So I suppose it’s a credit to the early character work that, by the end, I wanted more than just the clever “how they did it” explanations. But I was entertained. I was surprised and impressed by the final result. And that’s the true definition of magic—movie or otherwise.

Sowards, Screenwriter, Maybe it’s a good thing you’re not around to see this. Six years after your passing, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan – what I would kindly suggest is the great accomplishment of your career – is enjoying a sort of renaissance. Not necessarily on its own (countless) merits, but mostly because there’s this new flick in theaters, Star Trek Into Darkness, that is trying – and failing spectacularly – to mimic them. I’ll get to those merits (and failures) in a second, but first let me elaborate on this idea that Star Trek II is your greatest professional feat. I don’t mean to disparage your long career as a writer and producer in television. From Bonanza to The Streets of San Francisco to BL Stryker, you were the model of the network-era journeyman writer; a sort of narrative mechanic, who, within the airtight confines of an hour-long scripted drama, was able to tinker with the wheels and gears of a plot to keep it running efficiently. But despite this workmanlike competence, your experience was pretty limited. Mostly westerns, cop shows, legal dramas. By the spring of 1981, after more than two decades in the business, you’d never written for the big screen. And you’d never been hired to write science-fiction. Nonetheless, producer Harve Bennett brought you on board to help save the Star Trek universe. The franchise, which seemed primed to coast the post-Star Wars deep-space adventure frenzy, was in a precarious place. In 1979, the original crew of the USS Enterprise was brought together for Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Response was lukewarm. Robert Wise’s thoughtful, meandering approach to the genre had a difficult time finding an audience in the dawning era of Spielbergian summer blockbusters. While there remained a solid base of passionate Trekkers and Trekkies, the trick would be to draw in the casual moviegoers – the date night lotharios, the mall-haunting suburban kids with pockets full of allowance money – who held the power to push a movie out of the cult canon and into the mainstream. Those goals seem in opposition to each another, don’t they? Fan service vs. broad appeal. But, working with Bennett, who developed the story that you turned into a screenplay (at warp speed, to avoid the 1981 writer’s strike), you somehow managed to hit them both. Listen, Jack: when it comes to sequels, I don’t grade on a curve. You’re not getting any extra points for level of difficulty. I think telling a story with already-established characters in an already-established universe has just as many benefits as it does pitfalls. The pitfalls, obviously, are repetition, redundancy, and a misguided sense of responsibility to the bombastic and superfluous (bigger, in sequels, is rarely better). But the expositional simplicity of the sequel is an oft-overlooked asset. Spider-Man 2, unfettered by the obstructions of an origin story, is one of the great comic book films of all time. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is unquestionably a sequel; it assumes a congenital knowledge of the people and places and lore established in all previous iterations; the script drops you immediately into a false-start action sequence that, to someone unfamiliar with the Star Trek universe, might feel completely bewildering. A sequel, yes, but – here’s the brilliant part of what you did – not a sequel to the previous film. It’s a sequel to the original series. To a specific episode of the original series. Back to the source material. Back to basics. That was the genius of what you and Bennett did. In the 1967 Star Trek episode “Space Seed,” Kirk et al. encounter a derelict spacecraft from the ancient era of the 1990s; within, row upon row of genetic superpeople frozen in stasis. Their leader, Khan Noonien Singh, is thawed out and uses his commanding presence and yogic breathing techniques to briefly assume control of The Enterprise. He is thwarted (of course) and sent, by Kirk, to an uninhabited planet upon which he might indulge his megalomaniacal urges without hurting anyone. (American Netflix subscribers can watch the first twenty 20 minutes of Star Trek II, and, when Chekov and Captain Terrell first encounter Khan, switch over to “Space Seed” and watch the original episode in its entirety—it functions as a dramatization of Khan’s expository monologue, a deleted scene that gives you a sense of just how consistent Ricardo Montalban’s insane performance is). When this episode first aired, you were just beginning your career in television, penning westerns like Daniel Boone and The High Chaparral. Learning, I bet, the sort of hyper-efficient storytelling you’d later put to use when adapting the reflective mood and ambiguous conclusion of “Space Seed” into something a bit more consistent with the familiar beasts of a summer popcorn flick. Star Trek II’s MacGuffin is pretty brilliant: a bomb the rewrites the genetic code of an entire planetary body: the Genesis Device. But it’s the effortless weaving-together of all these separate threads – the research project headed by Dr. Marcus and her whiny son, the re-emergence of Khan and his Beyond Thunderdome-army, The Enterprise and her crew reduced to carrying out yet another boring training mission – and the logic of how those plotlines eventually fold together is deceptively simple. It’s a testament to your skill that each movement peaks at the exact right moment; these are the hallmarks of a storyteller who cut his teeth finding shrewd ways to build suspense before each commercial break (and pay it off right after).  You knew something that too few screenwriters mucking around Hollywood studios don’t seem to: a story doesn’t have to be complicated to be engaging. In fact, the opposite is often true. I’ll admit, I came to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan a little bit late. I was born in 1979, and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home was my jam. The whales, the time travel, the hijacked Klingon Bird of Prey—a seven year-old craves these simple, shallow pleasures. But, through my father, who was a meticulous VHS-tape archivist of late-night reruns, I was trained to be a fan of the original series. And, as a child of the cable TV generation, I couldn’t help but catch bits and pieces of Star Trek II while flipping through channels on a rainy weekend afternoon. But it wasn’t until a few years ago, at the Mayfair Theater, that I gave the flick an informed, engaged, grown-up viewing. And while I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it, I didn’t realize, until I saw J.J. Abrams’ own attempt at a Star Trek sequel, how good your film really was.  Now, I’m no hater of J.J. Abrams. In fact, I’m a bit of an apologist for his first Star Trek movie (Spock’s “cave of exposition” scene isn’t really that bad). It satisfied the supplicant in me. It delivered, generally, on the promise of spectacle. It had some neat moments that felt earned. Cool music. A few clever laughs. But even in that first film it seemed to be borrowing liberally from the blueprint you laid out, what with the fake-out opening sequence, the Kobayashi-Maru as foundational parable, and the fashion-retarded villain with a personal vendetta against a member of the crew. The writers – Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (paired, for the sequel, with noted philosophical obfuscator Damon Lindelof) – seem desperate, in this second flick, to connect with the Star Trek mythology in the same seamless way that you did. But they did themselves a disservice in the first film by linking both streams of the franchise as divergent alternate dimensions (okay, maybe the cave of exposition was that bad). They are now beholden to both the original series and the original film franchise. So, with Into Darkness, we get Tribbles; we get Harry Mudd; we get Dr. Marcus (who, in your film, is revealed to be the mother of Kirk’s child). We get Khan, too. And, sure, Benedict Cumberbatch has an undeniable charm and a cool gravelly voice—but he bears so little in common with Khan (the character, who, like Kirk and Spock and Bones and Scotty is, in the broad strokes of his persona, a vital part of the Star Trek mythos) that fitting him into the story feels like the most senseless, lazy sort of fan service.  (The writers have actually admitted to having retrofitted Khan-as-antagonist into the screenplay.) Which wouldn’t be so bad if Into Darkness didn’t fumble its way into the same thematic trap that has claimed so many recent blockbusters (begrudgingly, I’ll include The Dark Knight Rises on that list): paralyzing self-seriousness. Laid over the story is a paper-thin 9/11 allegory (what else?) that is naked in its striving for profundity, and is revealed during the climactic action sequence to be nothing more than an offensive thematic ploy (thousands of people appear to die in a single ecstatic CGI shot).   Needless to say, Jack, I felt a lot of feelings while watching Star Trek Into Darkness. Some nice. Some unpleasant. At the time, in the theater, assaulted by the noise, seized by the stuttering cuts, I didn’t think it was that bad. Worth the fourteen bucks for a 3D ticket—but just barely. But in revisiting Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, your simple, unpretentious, yeoman’s approach to the narrative made clear just how low my expectations were.   Looking back from the high perch of three decades, it’s easy to see why Star Trek II is such a beloved blockbuster. It’s a film written for the audience. The screenplay is a humble bit of genius. An act of generosity to both fans and casual filmgoers.  And your generosity didn’t stop there. You spent the last years of your life teaching film and television at UCLA. Which makes me wish I lived in some divergent reality in which Kurtzman, Orci, and Lindelof took one of your classes. Then I might have been able to watch another amazing Star Trek sequel.   Rest in peace,   Jared Young"},{"title":"After Earth","url":"/2013/06/07/after-earth","date":"2013-06-07 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":"Dear Jaden Smith’s Eyebrows, Principal Actors, That was a hell of a workout for you guys. It doesn’t seem fair. After Earth wasn’t supposed to be your movie. It was supposed to be Jaden Smith’s leading-lad coming out party, conceived, produced, and starring his leading-man dad, Will. But as soon as Jaden delivered his first lines as Kitai, a wannabe warrior living in a distant future, you must have realized how much his performance would rely on you. Answer: a lot. It’s not that your co-stars didn’t have the chance to prove themselves. In the interminably long opening monologue, Jaden’s vocal chords do their best to explain what we (apparently) need to know: thousands of years ago humans were forced to leave Earth after ravaging the environment and leaving the planet uninhabitable; they found a pristine world dubbed Nova Prime where it was safe to rebuild civilization and thrive. Or not. An alien race called the S’krell have similar plans for Nova Prime, and a vicious war ensues in which they unleash upon humanity an army of warriors that are able to sense their prey’s fear. Fortunately, superdad Cypher (Will Smith) is able to suppress his fear, becoming invisible to his enemies and something, something, something human victory is secured! (Was it exhausting to read that? Just imagine how exhausting it is to watch.) Jaden’s poor larynx must have been pretty decimated after delivering all that exposition in the film’s first ten minutes, because, for the rest of the film, you two are forced to be the outer space-Karate Kid’s primary method of expressing emotion. The onus fell on you, the suborbital ridge, to do the heavy lifting. And that’s a lot of lifting.  In the absence of help from any other limbs or organs, you heroically stepped up to convey young Kitai’s inner turmoil. Lowering to demonstrated his disappointment at not passing his space-ranger exams; frowning to express frustration that his dad isn’t as much a part of his life as he’d like; arching to illustrate the joy of accompanying his father on a training mission; lifting high to communicate the horror he feels when that mission, of course, goes terribly wrong. But you are only capable of so much. The corrugator supercilii muscle only moves in two directions, after all. Jaden Smith’s crinkled brow achieves little more than expressing the general notion that he has feelings. You know, that look teenage boys use to convince girls that they’re different than the other guys. Or we could just blame After Earth’s half-baked plotting for those shortcomings of emotion. With angry baboon rampages, giant bird attacks, and paralytic leech incursions, I don’t blame Will Smith’s face for retracting into a sour scowl and erasing every ounce of his natural charisma. Maybe it was a conscious choice. Maybe he wanted to place the focus on young Jaden. Sadly, however, the famed Smith charisma seems to be a recessive gene. Still, I’m glad you guys brought your A-game. No one else did. Frowningly, Casey Status: Return to sender (2/5)"},{"title":"Red Wedding?

Martin, Author of GAME OF THRONES, Fans and critics have been reeling since the Game of Thrones episode titled “The Rains of Castamere” aired. The reason, as you well know, was for seeing the (technically) well-executed final sequence dubbed the “Red Wedding”, where the eldest in the Stark family are brutally massacred – including an unborn child and caged direwolf. Fans of the books waited with baited breath for years to see this moment, turning those of us only familiar with the television series into the subject of YouTube reaction videos. Unfortunately, no one caught my indifferent shrug on camera, so I’ll do my best to sum it up for you in this letter. Let’s go back for a minute, since I’ve found this series to be the source of endless frustration. Season 1 had precisely three moments worth remembering. First, seeing the young Bran Stark pushed out the window in the pilot episode fueled my hate. This effectively compensated for my not caring about the myriad of other characters, so I came back for more. The show looked impressive. The characters sounded like they had purpose. Still, be damned if you could string together a storyline that made me care. Not until the truly bold execution of Ned Stark did the show feel like it had half the guts it always talked about spilling (but rarely bothered to show). And then, well, there was the season finale’s last shot with Daenerys. Memorable, certainly, but hardly for narrative reasons. For season two, I don’t even know where to begin. So little changed from start to finish, yet the series continued to amass an army of followers faster and more illogically than the Khaleesi. Episode 9 was again the only standout, but only because the show finally focused on a single story. Tyrion helped fend off an invading army, resulting in a scratch on his face and added frustration to his diminutive position in the Lannister House. In other words, nothing changed. You killed off a few secondary characters, shifted people from The North a bit further south and vise versa, and ended the season promising a Walking Dead mash-up. My dropped jaw was only at the service of a yawn, I assure you. And now season three. More plotting and politicking of stories that take a dragon’s age to ever intersect. This, and this alone, lends to the “shock” of the Red Wedding. The reason so many people are reacting is because they’ve been sedated into a coma over how stingy this series has been with progress. The world building has been so slow and laborious (not unlike the overlong title sequence), that people seem fooled by the sight of blood. Rest assured, if they took a few minutes to look at the big picture, they would realize that the wedding massacre has next to no outside consequence. Not for a moment did I believe that the Starks would return to glory. Their family has been a write-off for me since the end of Season 1, when momentum finally shifted to the other storylines. If the intention was to fool us into believe Ned’s son would rise up to reclaim the throne, the TV series did a piss-poor job of seeding that idea. Instead, the Red Wedding felt like a delayed inevitability – needlessly drawn out over two full seasons. So now, with that out of the way, the big “moment” that fans have been anticipating, I’m worried for what’s next. I want this show to be great – I really do. It’s the only reason I keep coming back. But this most recent episode seems to have crystalized everything that’s wrong with the series. With so many characters and diverging stories, we should be treated to grand moments every few episodes, not every few seasons. You know you’re in trouble when Downtown Abbey has been bolder in its first three seasons than you have.

It has to do with what makes a film worthy of playing at the Cannes Film Festival. Obviously, films selected at Cannes always reflect a unique take on a theme or idea. The French, after all, were the first to fully embrace auteur theory, and have always been eager to worship the work of a cinematic auteur. But it’s more than that.   I believe that all submissions to the festival are run through a computer algorithm that measures the consistency of the film’s art direction. If a rogue colour or flagrant shape invades the frame and contradicts the movie’s palette (established in the first few scenes), you can forget it. On both these fronts, Sarah Prefers to Run is worthy of being shown on the world’s most prestigious screens. Even if the film lack some of the simpler, emotional elements often craved by mainstream audiences. The auteur who guides your art direction in Sarah Prefers to Run is writer/director Chloé Robichaud, who, at age 25, is just a few years older than her protagonist Sarah (Sophie Desmarais). This gives the story a rare sense of authenticity, portraying the confusion of youth without the nostalgic hue of hindsight to soften the blow. In fact, the hue here is almost completely grey and white. From the props, to the sets, to the clothing on the extras—nothing strays too far from a subdued, colourless vision of a girl painfully trying to discover herself. Even those orange pylons are white in the film – it’s a nice touch. This pared-down approach is both the film’s biggest strength and its biggest commercial liability. Sarah is a simple girl. Frustratingly simple, at times. As the title suggests – and as the character states rather perfunctory whenever questioned – she simply likes to run. Sarah and Forrest Gump would probably make fast friends (but the conversations wouldn’t get very far). Those walls you choose to leave blank often mirror the glazed expression on Sarah’s face. Sarah is conflicted. Moving from Northern Quebec to Montreal with her platonic friend Antoine (Jean-Sébastien Courchesne), she attends university on a running scholarship but has no ambitions beyond circling the track. Her inability to see the big picture also makes her decision to marry Antonie – simply to be eligible for a special grant – more believable.  The fact she wears a black wedding dress to the ceremony is worth noting. It becomes clear, however, that Antoine’s feelings are growing within this relationship of convenience, while Sarah is simply drifting through university (and beginning to notice the other girls in the shower). At this point, hints of primary color emerge, but never in a manner that calls attention. After all, as Robert McKee says, if the hidden symbols in a film’s art direction draw attention to themselves, they are rendered powerless. But I think the fact that I was drawn consciously to your work is a compliment. It did, after all, do a lot of the emotional heavy-lifting—and, of course, got the film through that secret Cannes art-direction algorithm.

A special effects meta-comedy featuring young Hollywood stars playing (versions of) themselves? Doesn’t it sound kind of self-indulgent, prideful, decadent—a big inside joke that the audience will never be more than fractionally a party to? Even more worrisome: Seth Rogen co-wrote and co-directed the movie with his best pal Evan Goldberg, cast all his friends from Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared, and, from start to finish, stuffed the film so full of cameos that it risks playing out like an episode of TMZ irradiated by gamma rays. But big risks like this offer big rewards. And just as much as Rogen and Goldberg (and the rest of the cast) take a chance by putting themselves (literally) in the middle of a big-budget apocalypse scenario, so too does the audience bear a good amount of risk in watching it unfold: there’s nothing more unpleasant than spending two hours (and twelve bucks) watching a bunch of attractive people cracking wise and having fun with no concern for whether the audience is having fun, too (see Ocean’s Twelve). But you and the filmmakers (and me and my fellow filmgoers) can rest easy. Even though its artistic ambitions aren’t lofty, even though it’s one of those crowd-pleasing, impossible-to-quantify, eye-of-the-beholder-type movies (like all pure comedies are), I’m pretty comfortable saying This Is The End is the best flick I’ve seen so far this year. How? The skill that makes you good at your job, James, is what makes the performances – and the film – so great; you’re a lookalike who approximates the presence of one of our heroes for long shots and second unit stuff, and, in a sense, the actors are doing the same thing: standing in for themselves, approximating their own behavior, and doing it with such restraint, such sincerity, that nothing about the way they react to the decidedly outrageous situation they find themselves in (specifically, The Rapture) feels false. What helps to anchor the story in realness is the central relationship between Jay Baruchel (Jay Baruchel) and Seth Rogen (Seth Rogen). Jay arrives in L.A. to visit his old buddy, they go to a star-studded party during which, lo and behold, a lava-spewing sinkhole opens up, beams of light suck the penitent into the sky, and boner-sporting demons begin roaming in the streets. The buddies find themselves barricaded in an ultra-modern concrete mansion with Jonah Hill (as an overly-earnest Jonah Hill), Craig Robinson (as sensitive soul-man Craig Robinson), Danny McBride (in full Danny-McBride-as-Kenny-Powers-mode) and James Franco (as the dicknosingest James Franco that ever dicknosed).  Like last year’s 21 Jump Street, the central friendship gives the story a sweetness that, as circumstances become increasingly fantastical, keeps things steady, relatable, honest. Compare that sort of humanist approach to The Hangover Part 3, in which the two most eccentric characters are consistently subverting every social/moral/quantum rule with nonsense behavior that’s supposed to be funny because of how unfunny it is (I think that’s what they were going for, anyway). A movie like This Is The End is all about the audience’s relationship with the characters, and, with a bunch of notable pop culture figures playing themselves, their natural urge might be to parody themselves. Winking at the camera becomes a clever way to disprove the rumors, disarm the internet trolls. But what fun would it be to watch a bunch of caricatures? What Rogen and Baruchel and Hill and McBride and Franco and Robinson – and the countless others who pop up throughout – are able to conjure, by never taking the self-parody too far, is an effortless likability. The funny stuff that results is much more genuine than if I had they’d been compelling me to laugh at them.  But comedy is completely subjective. So I guess all I can really say with any certainty is that This Is The End made me laugh. A lot. More than I’ve laughed in a movie theater in a long, long time.    And, in the end, that’s all that really matters.

One night a year, all crime is made legal throughout a reconstituted United States and citizens are encouraged to “purge” their inner demons. Basically, it’s a feature film treatment of George Orwell’s “Two Minutes Hate” from 1984. Security footage in your opening sequence introduces us to the concept, depicting acts of grainy savagery with convincing realism. Seeing these violent outbursts from across the country effectively ignites our imaginations about all the narrative possibilities that exist – that is, until the movie turns into a pretty standard home invasion thriller.  See, despite the intriguing premise you helped establish, The Purge focuses exclusively on home security salesman James Sandin (Ethan Hawke). We first see him cruising around his well-to-do suburb, making sure his clients are ready for the big night. His own middle-class mansion is also fully equipped for lock-down, hoping the mechanical steel shutters will protect his wife Mary (Lena Heady), wayward daughter Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and gadget-loving son Charlie (Max Burkholder). But when bleeding heart Charlie let’s a wounded vagrant in off the streets for protection, the family becomes the target of a group of “hunters” who, on principle, refuse to allow this act of sanctuary go unpunished. The result is some good moral philosophizing within the family under intense pressure, and a bold mid-point decision that dictates how the rest of the story will unfold. This first half of the movie worked me over perfectly. I knew the film was a low-budget production (about $5 million, from the savvy producers of Paranormal Activity) and I could respect the decision to insulate the action. I assume, as well, that an infinitely scalable “Purge” series is also coming, rotating stories within this dystopian world and maybe eventually dealing with the political puppet masters. However, in this first incarnation, we’re stuck with a group of characters that too often make ridiculous decisions in the service of formulaic scriptwriting – be it arbitrarily separating the family for added tension or delaying inevitabilities to set-up “surprises” (which most people will see coming a mile away). And yet, The Purge finds a way to work overall. Early on, it does a good job suggesting that the low national crime rate is more a bi-product of an annual genocide that “purges” society of the lower classes than it is the result of successfully regulating violence.  This adds a welcomed layer to the conflict, even if the story’s murderers are psychotic slow-walkers in that typical movie villain way. The whole time, I couldn’t help thinking about your titles sequence, and the clumsy, awkward, and desperate violence in the streets.  Hopefully I’ll see you again in the next purge. For the right reasons.

I mean, I certainly understand why DC Comics trusted you to oversee Man of Steel and the relaunch of the Superman franchise. No one’s going to argue that your Dark Knight Trilogy – which successfully walked the line between honouring the source material and presenting it with a fresh vision – isn’t loved (for the most part) by both mainstream audiences and devoted fans of the comics. And, like any influential piece of pop art, the dark, gritty style of those films became de rigueur for superhero movies looking to be taken seriously. But here’s the thing: not every comic book movie needs that sheen of self-importance to be successful. If nothing else, Joss Whedon recently proved as much with The Avengers; good execution and joyous storytelling can impress as strongly as the darkest tragedy. You just need to know when to play which card. Batman, a character born of tragedy and anger, naturally falls into step with a dark vision. Superman, however, is no Batman. You might think that I’m picking on you a bit. Don’t get me wrong, there’s plenty of blame to go around. Screenwriter Davide Goyer and director Zack Snyder have to shoulder a lot of the responsibility for this misfire, but you also share story credit with Goyer, and Man of Steel has your fingerprints all over it. So much so that it actually feels like you and Goyer simply took the structure form 2005’s Batman Begins and slapped it onto the Superman mythology. Like that earlier film the backstory of Kal-El (Henry Cavill), last son of Krypton, is told through nonlinear flashbacks, jumping back and forth in time trying to tell a familiar story in an unfamiliar way creating a composite built from the character’s past experiences. Unfortunately this creates a major structural fault, as the entire first act of the movie, which begins with Kal’s birth, would not exist in his memory. The solution seems to have been to ignore this issue and rush headlong into the story, forcing the audience to catch up. While I’m a fan of narrative economy, the entire Krypton sequence had more of a “lets get this over with” feel than “try to keep up with us.” Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and the evil General Zod explain (well, more yell) their backstories to each other – nothing is shown. Instead, you and Snyder seem more interested in creating a version of Krypton that is so visually busy, it would have felt more at home in a Star Wars prequel. This rush might have made sense if Man of Steel was rushing toward the revelation of Superman himself, but the film seems strangely embarrassed by it’s own hero. Instead of embracing the innate goodness of Superman, you’ve added a layer of grime, as if to let the audience know you think he’s too square for a modern blockbuster. Henry Cavill, in his chiseled perfection, certainly looks the part of Superman, but he doesn’t feel the part. There’s a lot of looking-but-not-feeling going around in Man of Steel. The film is stuffed with good actors: Michael Shannon as Zod; Amy Adams as Lois Lane; Lawrence Fishburne as Perry white; Diane Lane and Kevin Costner as Ma and Pa Kent. But apart from Costner and Lane —  both of whom bring some much needed warmth to the film — everyone registers more as name checks than actual characters. Jimmy Olsen has been reinvented as Jenny Olsen, but her character is so insignificant, I didn’t realize who she was until reading over the credits a day later. And, in a depressing trend for blockbusters this year, Man of Steel seems more interested in creating a reaction from the audience by linking it’s imagery to a post 9/11 world. There is so much wanton destruction as Superman battles Zod in the film’s climax, that I was sure I was witnessing tens of thousands of deaths every minute in the background as the film focuses on the foreground action. What’s worse, Superman never does anything to stop this. The only way to see Superman save anyone in the Man of Steel is to watch the third act in reverse. And if anything in this film is truly tragic, it’s that.

Robinson, Production Designer, Even if you end up having a long and illustrious career in Hollywood, I’ll bet good money that The Kings of Summer will forever be your calling card. Every frame feels carefully populated with joy, heartbreak, and hope. Your production design in this film isn’t just impressive – it’s moving. Like an emotional time capsule, each set piece transported me back into adolescence. Not by recreating a specific era, but by evoking an overall feeling. That’s a rare gift to get from a film. Frankly, I never wanted to leave this rebellious teenage world you built in the wilderness. If that wasn’t enough, I think you’ve also patented a hot new architectural style: shabby nostalgia chic. And boy, does it work.  The “shabby” part of your designs are obvious but endearing. The story opens with Joe (Nick Robinson) rushing to finish one of the sorriest looking birdhouses ever assembled. The lopsided construction and mismatched materials are good for a laugh, but also contribute to building his character; Joe’s class project doesn’t represent hard work or professional aspirations, it’s just a sloppy last-minute failure. He’s a good looking, well-off suburban kid who can’t seem to get along with his dad (Nick Offerman) and takes out his pent-up frustration one slow-motion hammer blow at a time. When Joe, his best friend Patrick (Gabriel Basso), and tag-along Biaggio (Moises Arias) decide to run away to the forest together, that haphazard birdhouse proves to be a dry run for the sanctuary they plan to build. This summer project depends on a collection of discarded items, from recovered building materials to pieces of a port-a-potty.  The way these elements all come together to create this fortress of solitude feels both authentic and “only in the movies.” Like the film’s slick cinematography, with its beautiful long-lens shots, your work also qualifies as “chic”. In other words, simultaneously elegant and unhinged. The film, as well, is glossy enough for a wide theatrical release, but doesn’t suffer from the glaze of studio money that often imposes nicer homes, over-aged “young stars”, watered-down writing, and all the other pitfalls that give coming-of-age films that suffer from a sense of detachment from the material. The true master stoke of this film is the most intangible: nostalgia. This is a dangerous influence to incorporate, being highly personal and potentially alienating. But instead of setting the film in the past and filling it with pop culture references, we get a contemporary story where wistful feelings arise simply by letting director Jordan Vogt-Roberts expose the seams and rough edges of youth. The love story in the film between Joe and Kelly (Erin Moriarty) is appropriately clumsy and frustrating, and the friendship between the boys bounces between silly and serious with the appropriate momentum of a teenage mood swing. The final film swings back and forth in style and tone, too, but ultimately everything comes wonderfully together. Championing this film by design, Christopher Status: Priority Post (4.5/5)"},{"title":"World War Z","url":"/2013/06/19/world-war-z","date":"2013-06-19 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Marc Forster, Director,  We love you, Marc. You know that, don’t you? We care for you. We just want the best for you. That’s why we’re writing this letter. Because you have a problem. Everyone sees it. They see it, but they don’t necessarily understand it—and that’s the heart of the issue: common sense, comprehension, spatial logic. You’ve given up on these things. You’ve given up on us, Marc. You’ve given up on your audience.    You’re an addict.  There…I said it.  How did it start? Did some older kids trick you into it? You’ve been hanging out with that Paul Greengrass again, haven’t you? And now you’re hooked on the crystal meth of cinematographic styles: the hand-held shaky-cam. Cheap, easy thrills—that’s what you’re after. And it’s clear, with World War Z, that you just can’t handle them.  I can’t help but feel like this is partly our fault. Much of the respect for Monster’s Ball and Finding Neverland was accorded (disproportionately, maybe) towards the actors: Halle Berry, for her Oscar-winning performance; Johnny Depp for his Oscar-nominated performance. The knock on you, Marc, was that you were invisible behind the camera. In an industry so obsessed with style, that praises big personalities not for their talent or skill but merely for their bigness, the proletarian competence of your filmmaking went unnoticed. And I feel like maybe you took that inattention to heart.    And so we ended up with Quantum of Solace. It was…not good. While Hollywood might sometimes fall short in delivering coherent narrative or moral complexity, it rarely produces something as ugly as your follow-up to the dashing James Bond reboot Casino Royale.. It’s one of the most incomprehensible studio films. Ever. Of all time.    Don’t bother with the excuses, Marc. I’ve heard them all before. Sure, yes, it was your first pure action movie and maybe you were overcompensating for your inexperience. And, yeah, all the other cool directors were doing it, too: JJ Abrams, Alfonso Cuaron. But you took their spasmic kineticism to a whole new level. You mistook agitation for excitement, obscurity for intensity. You thought that your epileptic camera and impressionistic editing mimicked the turmoil taking place within the world of the movie, when, in fact, it was causing sensual turmoil in the world of the movie theater. It was assaulting. You assaulted us, Marc.   And here you are, making the same mistakes in World War Z. Sure, the eye adjusts—after a while. But by then it’s too late. We’ve already missed much of what happens in the opening action scene, as we follow a former United Nations diplomat/mercenary/doctor (Brad Pitt’s professional history is about as clear as the camerawork) and his family as they escape from a Philadelphia traffic jam overrun by the sprinting undead. Later, he’s trapped in a stairwell. And attacked (I think). And (somehow) escapes. Then (possibly) runs.  It’s an imitation of action. And a bad one. But worse, it clouds some potentially interesting moments. When Pitt and his family find themselves trapped in a drug store besieged by looters, a policeman appears, seems about to help them, but instead walks past and starts pulling items off the shelf. What we are just barely able to catch a glimpse of (since the inattentive camera immediately swings back for a reaction shot) is that the officer is sweeping boxes of baby formula into his arms. What could have been a poignant way to demonstrate how individual desperation leads to collapse of the infrastructure is, instead, a gimmicky, meaningless misdirect.  But I wouldn’t be writing this intervention letter to you, Marc, if I didn’t think there was light at the end of the tunnel. You’re not a lost cause. As much self-destructive obfuscation as there is in World War Z, there is hope, too. After an hour-and-a-half of messy chase scenes and generic CGI shots of hundreds of thousands of human bodies hurling themselves against walls and windows and sometimes twining together like a colony of ants, the climax of the movie take place in a quiet laboratory, and unfolds slowly, silently, with a clear sense of the surrounding space and how the characters are moving through it. Finally your camera settles down (the operator’s arms got tired, I guess) and we get a sequence that captures the queer tension inherent in all zombie movies, the isolation, the creeping sense of danger. It’s credit to you, in a summer season that seems the apex of Hollywood’s penchant for inhuman, empty spectacle, that this mostly-inhuman, mostly-empty spectacle resolves in a moment of complete stillness.

Some dismiss the technique as pure theatrics, while others assume it only works on weak-minded individuals. But I know better. On multiple occasions, I’ve been fully hypnotized in front of hundreds of people, and recently took hypno-birthing classes with my wife. Suffice to say, I understand the power of the mind to overcome fears, fool the senses, and even – according to this film – recover suppressed memories. All it takes is strong focus, trust in your ‘storyteller’, and the ability to suspend your own inner narrative. In other words, exactly the same techniques required to enjoy a movie as silly as Trance. Directed by the hyper-kinetic hand of Danny Boyle, the story follows an art auctioneer named Simon (James McAvoy) who gets mixed up in the robbery of a rare painting. The answer to how everything went wrong is buried deep within his subconscious, so a hypnotherapist (Rosario Dawson) is recruited to help unlock the mystery. Although Simon was knocked out at one point during the crime, he’s the only one who could know how the heist went wrong. Simon claims he wants to retrieve the painting (in fact, his life depends on it), yet he struggles to piece together the puzzle during sessions. This is not unlike the people who rush to the stage at a hypnotist show claiming to be willing participants, but who can’t fully commit to “going under”. It’s probably the most realistic aspect of hypnosis in the film. When Simon does start to see answers, they are often a mash-up of his own personal desires and convoluted past experiences. This allows Boyle to do some funky mindbending, and opens the door for some of the film’s most striking visuals. But overall, the film remains routed in the colourful but controlled world Boyle is famous for. It’s a stylized reality where characters are pushed to their moral limits and forced into desperately uncomfortable situations.  But hey, they’re just characters in a film – you can do that. In reality, it’s a lot more complicated. At one point we’re told that five per cent of the population is considered to be “highly suggestible” and can be made to do “just about anything”. That’s a great line for the trailer, but obviously is a crock. Hypnosis merely harnesses a person’s own freewill and, at best, lowers inhibitions (not unlike alcohol). Simon, for a large part of the film, is a great example of that. We understand that he has made certain decisions voluntarily leading to his predicament. But what the hypnosis reveals about his true personality doesn’t just stretch the limits of hypnosis, but good screenwriting. That said, I have to say I rather enjoy being under Danny Boyle’s spell – even if I feel a little embarrassed for it when walking out of the theatre.

Sound design has to be one of the great misunderstood arts of filmmaking. If you do your job right, no one knows you even touched the film; your design feels as natural as the world we re-enter afer the credits roll. But you know better. Almost every sound accompanying the onscreen images is completely crafted. And yet, most people are unaware of the ingenious ways you recreate real world sounds with the most unlikely items.  Watermelons hit with rubber hoses become punches to the head. Fresh celery broken in half is snapping bones. I don’t want to know how you solved the challenges presented to you in Zack and Miri Make a Porno. But even when you’re working on an animated film - a prequel, no less - do you ever find yourself returning to the same bag of tricks? After 86 movies, are you still reusing your existing library of roars, screams, and crashes, or creating something new? I couldn’t help but think of this while I watched Monsters University, but probably not for the reasons you think. Yes, as a follow-up, there are plenty of callbacks to Monsters Inc., the 2001 film that introduced us to Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and Sully (John Goodman). Those two, plus a few other familiar characters (like Steve Buscemi’s slithery Randall Boggs, who I was particularly pleased to see), are training to harness children’s screams in order to power, well, whatever that world they inhabit is called. It’s not the familiarity of these elements that struck me, though. It was, instead, the film’s structure: that of a 1980s-era college comedy. Revenge of the Nerds, to be specific. An R-rated sex comedy might not seem like the obvious template for a G-rated family film, but it works surprisingly well. Taking the confident heroes from the first film and remaking them as the oddball campus castoffs is just enough to make things feel fresh. This approach also gives you a new palette to work with. Instead of the industrial soundscape of Monsters Inc., you’re forced to ground things a little more in the real world to emphasize elements of a slapstick buddy comedy. Hey, maybe all your work on Kevin Smith’s projects prepared you more than I thought. As happy as I was to watch Mike and Sully follow the college comedy blueprint – the stern dean (Helen Mirren) who takes an instant dislike to them, the jock fraternity who rejects them, the loser fraternity they’re forced to join, etc. – I wasn’t sure if children would understand this nod to a very specific sub-genre. But like Pixar’s best films, Monsters University works just fine without that context. Director Dan Scalon relies on solid filmmaking, valuing character over “nudge-nudge, wink-wink” in-jokes to get his laughs. The references children will connect with come from your sound design. And that’s where Monsters University faltered a bit for me. In it’s third act, when as the film comes closer to Monsters Inc.’s world of clanging portals and screaming humans, Monsters University starts to feel familiar in that been-there-done-that way. A revelation in Monster’s University’s denouement even, unfortunately, undermines the power of my favourite sound in the original: children’s laughter.  Overall, though, Monsters University, like your sound design, takes something familiar and changes the context just enough so it feels like it was always meant to be that way.

Well, not you specifically, but what you represent. After working for free, calling in a million favours and stretching every last dime they raised (and then some), a lucky filmmaker might earn a small commission to actually release their passion project. The catch is that it’s usually just enough to cover your famous errors and omissions insurance. Distributors require this liability protection against the unauthorized use of titles, formats, characters, ideas, or other potential lawsuits against defamations of character, breaches of contract or invasions of privacy. You have to admit: in the age of WikiLeaks, this all seems rather hilarious. Only a few years ago, a rabble rousing Aussie named Julian Assange almost single-handedly convinced millions of people to throw up their middle fingers at everything you stand for.  And yet here you are, working for a film about him. It’s almost as ironic as the story of WikiLeaks itself. According to Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney (and this very slick, non-low budget documentary film), the legend of Assange begins in 1989. A group of Australian hackers, for which Assange was part of (sorry, allegedly part of – we need to cover those legal bases), attacked NASA programmers with the WANK worm. It’s not as disgusting as it sounds – basically, just a self-replicating computer virus used to show off their hacking skills and promote an anti-nuclear agenda. Still, pretty scary stuff when lives are on the line during a shuttle launch. Fast-forward to Iceland in 2006 and the creation a WikiLeaks – the infamous whistleblowing website used to publish internal and classified documents. Through a collection of archival footage and home videos, Gibney provides an impressive-looking but sometimes slowly paced portrait of one of the 21st century’s most controversial figures. The storyline of the film, much like that of the WikiLeaks website, is impossible to separate from Assange himself. It is told through interviews with security experts, people once in Assange’s inner circle, and Gibney’s own voiceover. Assange himself did not participate,requesting a $1 million appearance fee to be in the film. Apparently, he doesn’t realize how many documents on him already exist and can be exploited without his consent… I know. You’re allowed to laugh when he calls you threatening a lawsuit. So does the film contain erroneous claims about Assange? Maybe. Does his omission hurt the final film? A bit, but it also feels appropriate. The hypocrisy, and brilliant strategy, of the government simply targeting Assange and not the major news networks who published the same documents is well articulated by others. Bradley Manning, the arrested U.S. solider who actually accessed the original major military documents, is also absent (for more sympathetic reasons) and only given voice through his old chat messages. This, however, allows us to build a compassionate and tragic story around him – arguably, one that’s even more compelling than Assange’s. Plus, for those infamous “legal reasons”, we know Assange wouldn’t have addressed certain issues anyway, including the (strange) sexual assault charges which have clouded his entire WikiLeaks mission. But that’s okay. I rather like the amateur theory floated his friend – that Assange, the vagrant father of four children to four different women, has a deep psychological need to plan his “roots” somewhere; hence the unprotected sex stories. Like The Social Network’s central premise that Mark Zuckerberg was a social misfit who created Facebook to be accepted, Assange’s personal legacy is now in the hands of others to piece together from whatever they can dig up. Transparency isn’t so easy after all, is it?

The Antichrist, in the 2006 remake of The Omen? Don’t take it too personally, I’m certain they meant well. The casting-call for the role probably just stipulated ‘intense’, not ‘creepy’, ‘chilling’, ‘terrifying’, or any other such synonyms. Yes, I’m sure of it. And anyway, don’t be disheartened, thanks to your performance in Before Midnight, you’ve successfully shrugged off being typecast as Satan’s spawn by portraying the most affable and least obnoxious teenager in the history of film.   Before Midnight continues the distinctly modern romance of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy). Nine years after the events of Before Sunset – and a staggering eighteen years since they first met in Before Sunrise – we find that, while the couple has aged, they haven’t necessarily matured. This time, it’s less star-crossed lovers and more crossed wires. In the domesticated adult world, bearing the responsibilities of parenthood and the stress of working life, Jesse and Celine are much more grounded than we might anticipate—after all, these are two people fated to be together, right? But what may come as quite a shock to fans of the previous two instalments is that in many ways, they seem like a rather average, even ordinary, couple.   I realise, Seamus, that I’m assuming you’ve seen the previous two films. I hope you have!  I was only six-years old when Before Sunrise was released. I watched it when I was about your age. Most fifteen-year old kids are into action -movies, but some are just born with a sentimental streak.  In case you haven’t seen them, let me fill you in. Each film in this quietly brilliant trilogy has explored what love means at different stages of life. As the protagonists age, as priorities shift and change, their viewpoint on that essential question evolves. Before Sunrise—set when your character, Hank, was just a glint in young Jesse’s eye—was full of youthful optimism and burgeoning romance, with only a hint of world-weary cynicism. Before Sunset flipped that balance, and was more about love lost than love gained.  In contrast, this latest film has an equal balance of romance and pessimism. But the romance has changed. The emphasis is on long-term commitment rather than idealistic and ephemeral one-night encounters in picturesque European cities. Instead of sprawling existential discussions, we have comparatively banal chats about work and kids, interspersed with fiery and tempestuous rows. Seamus, I think it’s clear that Hank is the catalyst for these arguments, as Jesse struggles to reconcile his position as an absentee father with his commitment to Celine. Despite your limited time onscreen, you make a significant impression upon the audience. Especially from Jesse’s guilt-ridden perspective.  Many would have predicted (myself included) that Jesse and Celine would exist in some kind of lover’s paradise following Before Sunset. Yet Before Midnight is much more intelligent than that. It asks serious questions about what it really means to spend your whole life with just one other person. Love may change, but that doesn’t make it any less beautiful or any less real. Jesse and Celine remain a fascinating pair to spend time with, and if this is indeed the last we’ll see of them, it’s a fitting and emotional farewell.  Will there be a sequel nine years from now? Will we catch up with Hank (and, by extension, you)? I’m not sure. But hopefully, in the meantime, your parents won’t recommend you for any more films involving the Prince of Darkness. Like Jesse, I’ll bet your folks mean well. But damn, being pigeonholed as the origin of all evil is enough to get any kid down. Yours hopefully, Ross Status: Priority Post (5/5)"},{"title":"White House Down","url":"/2013/06/28/white-house-down","date":"2013-06-28 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear David Loveday, Senior Pyrotechnician, You blew it, Dave. I know you were badly outgunned. I know the numbers were stacked against you. But you should have fought harder. When faced with a modern high-tech enemy, one hell-bent on rendering you obsolete, you need to stand your ground. It’s the basic principle of every action movie—even the really bad ones (ahem). Instead, you let Hollywood supervillain Roland Emmerich win the day. His cheap, labour-saving, 90s-grade digital explosions undermine any sense of emotional stakes White House Down could have hoped to earn. When that first CGI flash erupted in the Capitol building, the only loss I mourned was your profession. There’s just no substitute for real fire. It’s the reason Backdraft will still hold up 50 years from now*. Bad computer-generated flames lack any sense of danger and presence. They’re an easy stock effect included in even the most basic consumer-level editing programs. Big budget movies usually manage to blend the practical effects with the computer wizardry, but this desire to integrate the real deal says something. Hell, the fact an old-fashion fire-starter like you was even hired says everything. Seeing a real pyrotechnic display really gets the blood going. It could be an actual hospital building, like in The Dark Knight. It could be a splintering miniature of the White House, like Emmerich previously blew up so effectively in Independence Day (which becomes a surprisingly unlaboured meta-reference in this, his new film). But a well-placed, well-executed blast accomplishes everything an action movie sets out to do. And trust me, this movie needed all the help it could get. Where to start? The plodding pace that fails to generate an ounce of tension? The choppy slow-motion thrown in as an afterthought? The ham-fisted attempts at iconic moments, like the diplomatic president who, after being taunted for his “…mightier than the sword” philosophy, eventually stabs a villain with a ballpoint pen while shouting: “I choose the pen!” Yup, that actually happened—despite how hard the sound designers tried to bury it in the mix. But at least that moment was trying to do something new. This is just another Die Hard cut-and-paste job. Even the title is lazy (another way that Olympus Has Fallen proves itself a superior film). From the self-narrating hero to hackers who cue up Beethoven music, White House Down is paying tribute in the worst way possible; by being derivative without being ironic. The tone is even insultingly mawkish, with spectators gathering outside the White House during a 9/11-level attack, cheering the military as if they’re watching a rock concert. The film eventually devolves into a full-out comedy— well, at least I burst out laughing at the way the day was finally saved. When everything feels fake, we’re allowed to laugh. When things look great – like the wide shot of the crumbling Capitol building – we can’t help but marvel. And that draws us in. There are a number of well-crafted moments in which the danger feels at least a little bit palpable, and in those scenes I can feel your work. But even Channing Tatum’s undeniable charm isn’t enough to bring the house down. Further down, I guess.

I don’t mean that as a shot at the film’s quality; I’m talking about public perception of animated films in general. When it comes to summer releases, animated films, as far as moviegoers seem to be concerned, fall into two basic tags: the one from Pixar, and everything else. With Despicable Me 2 opening only a week and a half after Pixar’s own Monsters University, I’m sure you had your marketing work cut out for you.  Now, I’m aware it’s a critical fallacy to judge a film based on what it’s not. It’s an easy trap to fall into and– in the spirit of full disclosure – I’ve been guilty of that sin myself (sorry, Man of Steel, but you had it coming). So before this turns into an Armond White-style list of arbitrary comparisons*, I’ll assure you, that’s not what I’m here to do. (Besides, you can read my thoughts on Monsters University on your own time.) From your own marketer’s point of view, there’s certainly plenty to get an audience interested in Despicable Me 2. As a sequel, much of your heavy lifting is already done: Steve Carell’s Gru, the former-evil-scientist-turned-adoptive-father-to-three-daughters, as well as his army of yellow, squat, not-too-bright (but zany!) minions need no introduction. And the addition of Kristen Wiig, Ken Jeong, Benjamin Bratt, and Steve Coogan may not bring in the kids, but it does let the parents know that there is some top-drawer comic talent working alongside Carell.  Story wise, this also seems like a pretty easy sell, introducing some standard-but-fun spy film conventions into the Despicable Me universe. Contacted by the Anti Villain League, Gru is teamed up with Agent Lucy Wilde (Wiig) to investigate a plot that involves a giant flying magnet, world domination, and the local shopping mall. It’s is a good set up, and Carrell and Wiig, posing as new mall shop owners, make a cute, supposedly mismatched undercover odd couple, even thought the outcome of their relationship is never in question. Unfortunately, like many marketing campaigns, this film is all set up. It stumbles in delivering the goods. When first given his assignment, Gru is shown a number of possible suspects, all shop owners. But what looks to be the set up to a fun caper – the reclusive Gru forced to interact with his fellow shop keeps – is mostly a dead end. Sure, there are two possible villains (Bratt and Jeong), but as it unfolds, Despicable Me 2 loses its focus, adding extra stories (Gru’s dating life, the first crush of one of his) that, while cute, drain much of the primary narrative’s momentum. A few sequences that rely a little too much on pop culture references also do no favours, making the film itself feel less sure about its central premise than it should.  Still, like the expertise you bring to your projects, Despicable Me 2 does understand its target demographic. The theatre in which I watched it was full of children delighted with all of its busyness (or maybe because of it), and they didn’t seem phased by, say, whether or not they grasped why a Barry White song was being used at a particular moment. For that, I’ll give the film its due credit. I just wish I could have bought into it as wholly as they did.

It’s actually a huge pile of block-busting fun. How is that even possible? The story consists of humankind’s last desperate battle against impossible aliens rising up out of the sea, where all hope lies with giant (and I mean freakin’ huge) robots and some sick and troubled people. Director Guillermo del Toro and screenwriter Travis Beacham obviously sent you some anime references before production. The influences are clear, but instead of any name-checks, they simply borrowed to give their story shape and heft. In fact, the key thread that seems to tie the film together is the actual fighting. The massive robot-vs-monster punch-fights have a wonderful physicality to them. Clearly you were thinking of how these battles would actually play out, and how to add stakes and drama to all-CGI scenes. Awesome. Well done. Unlike almost every other movie this summer, I knew what was going on during almost every moment in each fight scene – and I cared. On the human side, key emotional moments are punctuated with confrontation and duels. The interpersonal punch-fights sort out the negative even positive relationships between characters, giving them depth and moving the plot while still being action-tastic. Thankfully, this movie is also not this year’s Prometheus. The actors are used well. Idris Elba gets to do his thing! The scientists are interesting and enjoyable, even when they are doing really stupid things, played for fun and profit by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman. The leads, Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Hunnam are fine. In fact, all the actors are put to good use, well choreographed to the needs of an entertaining action extravaganza. Don’t get me wrong – this isn’t the best movie ever. It’s not going to change your mind about anything or introduce any novel plot twists you’ve never seen (although having a male and female lead that don’t hook up was pretty damn refreshing). But I am pleased because I wasn’t annoyed by the end of it. The movie let me like it without being brooding or mopey (surprising, considering the dark subject matter). If I have let my critical compass go a bit off-center, I can’t be blamed. The themes in this (and every?) summer are clearly laid out. Man of Steel, Iron Man 3, Star Trek Into Darkness, and World War Z all rely on the same heavy-handed bits. There are the 9/11 parallels, man crushes, hand-job treatment of the military, unconvincing emotional arcs, two-hour-plus runtimes, the deaths of thousands, and some half-witty dialogue to brighten it all up. In the end you mostly feel tired, and the lack of subtext or even text makes you regret talking about the movie too much afterwards. But this time, I didn’t fight it. And those robots! They were really big. Which makes me want to ask you something I wouldn’t ever do in person. Your IMDB bio says you are shorter than Jackie Chan. Was it weird to plan such big fights? Or did that make you the perfect man for the job? You don’t have to answer.  Punching out, Cory"},{"title":"Grown Ups 2","url":"/2013/07/12/grown-ups-2","date":"2013-07-12 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear April Rose, Hot Dance Teacher, I know your character had a name in the film. I heard it. I even tried to remember it, I swear. But I was just so… distracted. Clearly I’m not alone. Even the crack team at IMDb, who seem to capture every production detail of a movie, simply credit you as Hot Dance Teacher.  You have numerous lines of dialogue, a couple of scenes, and even a tender moment with Stone Cold Austin. But in the end, obviously none of that mattered. We were all numbed and pacified by the simple pleasures you provided.  And this, in a nutshell, is the entire strategy of Grown Ups 2.  It’s nothing but non-stop childish, ridiculous, primitive, and – fine, I’ll say it – embarrassingly effective pandering. Please tell me this doesn’t hurt my chances with you… seeing me as a serious film critic, that is. Going in, I promised myself not to reward any crotch shots with laughter. No fart joke would be tolerated. Any homophobic stereotypes would meet the wrath of my eventual review. After all, someone has to hold these multi-millionaire knuckleheads accountable, right? The average American moviegoer sure as hell hasn’t. I mean, this is a sequel after all – Hollywood’s definition of success. I somehow avoided the original man-child temper-tantrum that undoubtedly was the first Grown Ups, but was obliged to see this film. And so, at the risk of being completely lost by a complicated plot and evolved character dynamics, I went in cold. Stone cold. Remember, I’m a critic. Within the first 5 minutes, I wanted to roll my eyes when that deer urinates into Adam Sandler’s gapping mouth. I swore that all this slapstick humour was way beneath me.  And dammit, there was no way that Kevin James’ lame burp-fart-sneeze combo trick could ever win me over, no matter how many times it was repeated (and it’s a lot). I was almost successful on that last one, but I can’t be sure. The packed screening I attended was roaring with so much laughter, I can’t even remember my own response. I succumbed to mob mentality. Apparently, it even applies to comedy; when a movie is this big and the jokes are this broad – and that critical mass is reached – people just can’t help but respond. Come on, you’re the physical embodiment of big and broad appeal. You know exactly what I’m talking about. Think of your scene where all these men attend a children’s ballet recital just to oggle you. They feel safety in numbers – not worried someone will call the cops at the lone creeper in the back row. That’s exactly the strange social permission this film banks on. It wedges in ridiculously hot women flaunting their assets every single chance it gets – cheerleader car washes, bikini-clad college parties, ass-slapping yoga classes, etc. But don’t worry kids, and girlfriends, and wives – that’s okay! Because it’s surrounded by “funny”. We’re laughing at how much we love it!  Nothing wrong there. Then the film is jam packed with friendly faces. Like the Lonely Island crew getting wet and nasty in short-shorts (see! something for the ladies!), or Steve Buschemi as an effeminate driver ed instructor, or Taylor Lautner doing really –like really – impressive action star moves (see! Something ACTUALLY for the ladies!). I wanted to scream at the screen – stop making me smile! And then the effects. This movie obviously had budget to burn. The effects are actually well done. People slam into things, get shot through the air, roll down hills and are abused in all sorts of ways, but it all looks pretty good. They paid big money for those laughs, and sometimes it actually pays off (the inflatable raft gimmick, in banking terms, is just too big to fail). So let’s just admit that this film was a perfect fit for you. And America. And maybe even me. If the mood is right. You just have to give it a chance. Go ahead. Think about it. I’ll be waiting in the back row.  Christopher Status: Standard Delivery (3/5)"},{"title":"Sharknado","url":"/2013/07/17/sharknado","date":"2013-07-17 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Thunder Levin, Writer, Take me back to the beginning, to that eureka moment when everything clicked. I can’t imagine the euphoria you must have felt knowing your years of ripping off genre films had finally paid off with something original. No more mockbusters of Pacific Rim, Battleship, and zombies-versus-whatever. You must have known this was it—your ticket to the big leagues. You came up with a concept so bold that no major studio would dare touch it. A title so bankable, so compelling, that the script was irrelevant. This threat you invented out of thin air (really thin air) is so twisted that your tombstone will inevitably read: Herein lies the man who gaveth the world its first sharknado.  That’s right, the first. Because there’s bound to be a tsunami of sequels, spin-offs, and knock-offs. Oh, the irony. You may go on to more audacious projects, but it’s doubtful any will be so incompetently made. The piss-poor special effects, the incoherent editing, the completely inconsistent treatment of locations and weather – unfortunately, these low-budget tropes aren’t leveraged for laughs the way I expected. Instead, it feels like the hardworking men and women behind the scenes just weren’t up to the challenge of bringing your ambitious vision to life.  Yet somehow, your genius shines through. Physics, biology and basic logic have never been so willingly victim to one man’s brilliance. The characters accept sharks raining down from the sky, and frankly, so do we. Really, Thunder—enjoy this moment. Because you’re bound to attract even bigger stars, but few will look as lost and pathetic as Tara Reid. Worse yet, few will give performances as sincere and irony-free as Ian Ziering’s (he’s really earning his paycheck in earnest). Even Cassie Scerbo’s character – with her oh-so-tragic backstory that you may have, sort of, kind of borrowed from Jaws – is actually, you know, decent. Thank God you found such a novel way to bring her back from certain death. The film’s most fun scene, bar none. We live in an age of been there, seen that. Nothing’s new anymore.

As the day went on, I realized I was coming down with something. It started with a scratchy throat; then  some general achiness. By the time I was heading out to the show, my eyes felt so tired, the notion of watching a movie started to feel like too much effort. So, first things first: do you know what I might have come down with? Are there any treatments? Should I see someone? Anyway, where were we? Right, RED 2. I can see why this film needed a unit nurse on it. An action movie with this many stunts and pyrotechnics certainly has ample opportunity for on-set injuries - I mean that in the best sense possible. One of the best things about RED 2 is its old fashioned approach to on-screen action. The ‘old’ may only go as far back as the 1980s, but that’s okay, since that’s most of RED 2’s stars had their heydays. And while the movie deals with the inability to ever escape your past, it also (very marginally) deals with growing older. And with a cast that in large part resembles a retirement home, it couldn’t have hurt to have a full-time nurse on standby. Bruce Willis and John Malkovich reprise their roles as ex-black ops agents (RED being an acronym for “Retired, Extremely dangerous”), forced back into action when they are framed as the instigators in a plot to detonate an ultra-powerful atomic device for, and end up targeted for the kind of retirement that doesn’t involve rounds of golf or trips to COSTCO. Helen Mirren, Mary Louise Parker, and  Catherine Zeta Jones  are along for the ride as, in order, An ex-MI6 operative, Willis’s current flame, and Willis’s former flame (and KGB femme fatal, naturally). As a group, these actors area lot of fun – not as much fun as the movie thinks they are, but fun nonetheless. Which is a relief. After this year’s dismal A Good Day to Die Hard, it’s nice to see Willis in a somewhat competent action film. Instead of relying on gimmicky – and trendy – shaky cam cinematography, director Dean Parisot actually seems interested in crafting scenes that make sense spatially and physically. To a point at least. As RED 2  goes along, it becomes more interested in making its cast look cool. Which is a problem. I was game to hop along for the bumpy ride, even if I didn’t think everything was clicking. I didn’t even mind the liberal borrowing from other, better films (among the films that it lifted from, I noted Charade, The Bourne Identity, The Matrix, and Mission: Impossible: Ghost Protocol), but things started to creak like joints that haven’t been used in a long time. To remedy this, instead of following the advice you might give, to ease into things, use slow, steady progress until you’re ready to run again, RED 2 starts to flail like an over-the-hill jock trying to reclaim his glory with no warm up. By the time Willis and pals are shooting up an embassy in a scene that not only adds nothing to the story, but also has our main characters mowing down what seem to be (from what I could tell) innocent guards doing their job, I was ready to check myself out. That there was 20 minutes left only made things worse. I felt like a patient in the ER  with a recurring injury; I know what’s wrong, I know what the diagnosis will be, but I still have to wait for the on-call doctor to see me so that I can leave. But to my original point, should I get this flu checked out?

The heat. The humidity. The relentless and ruthless and utterly inhuman Hollywood spectacle. Indeed, the summer of 2013 may to prove to be a tipping point for popular cinema. The same way that the summer of ‘76 ushered in the era of the summer blockbuster, the summer of ’13 may very well prove to be the ignominious end of the summer blockbuster.   So what a relief, in the middle of July, to see a movie that earns the discomfort of the audience—an effective, affecting, well-made horror flick. The Conjuring isn’t a great film. It doesn’t do anything new. As it coasts along, the ticking-off of genre tropes feels almost self-conscious: the dog that refuses to enter the house, the precocious children preyed upon by unseen spirits, the creepy atonal music box, the flocks of kamikaze birds, and, most tired of all, the stringy-haired ghoul in a white nightdress crouched and crawling and pouncing. But I found all that sameness easy to forgive. Ultimately, The Conjuring is an exercise in craft. As computer-generated imagery makes it possible for filmmakers to show us anything, and as that lack of boundaries continues to coopt the language of film, director James Wan, by demonstrating a concern for things like spatial logic and sequential clarity, feels like he’s time-travelled to the present from a simpler, more comprehensible past. Sure, Wan operates in a strange tonal space (the bright-eyed earnestness of the ghost-hunters played by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, even as they spit out their absurd paranormal lingo, seems to be setting up a joke that never pays off), but he knows, unlike so many contemporary Hollywood filmmakers, how to tell a coherent visual story. And that’s where you come in, Mark.  Horror films are all about framing. And Wan’s great gift as a filmmaker is that he’s always pointing you and your camera in the right direction. Much of the tension in The Conjuring comes from our understanding of the way horror movies work, so, when a character is standing at the kitchen sink and the shot is framed to show the darkened window behind him, our attention – consciously or not – is drawn away from the action in the foreground and towards the empty space beyond, a black abyssal rife with possibility. The danger and unease comes from those empty spaces. And Wan doesn’t abuse them; no, he’s conservative with his scares. There are only five or six in the course of the movie, but the anticipation and trepidation is continuous. You move your camera with purpose, with a stillness and patience that proves visceral feelings isn’t exclusively a product of epileptic cinematography. The story is all pretty standard stuff: young family moves into creepy house, finds a hidden cellar, doors creak, spirits possess. The cast, here, which, along with Wilson and Farmiga, includes Ron Livingstone and the rather terrific Lili Taylor, feels at times almost too good for the material, which contributes again to that sense of parody that, as the final scenes play out with no double-reverse metatextual trickery, is apparently accidental. But perhaps it’s all about how you frame it. Right, Mark? All these smugly self-referential, desperately self-serious summer movies I’ve been seeing this summer—maybe I was too busy looking past the action in the foreground to appreciate the simplicity of what was unfolding right in front of my eyes.   Sincerely, Jared Young 3.5/5 (Air Mail)  "},{"title":"Only God Forgives","url":"/2013/08/01/only-god-forgives","date":"2013-08-01 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Kapong ‘Shi’ Kornporiphan, Still Photographer, You’ll notice I’m not attaching one of your own photos to this letter. There wasn’t much point. As good as your work is, Shi, it never tops the meticulously composed framing of Only God Forgives. There’s a Stanley Kubrick-level of discipline to every single shot of this film, which feels pretty apt, coming from Eyes Wide Shut cinematographer Larry Smith. I mean the guy’s first film gig was chief electrician on Barry Lyndon – clearly he knows a thing or two about lighting. Then some fresh face like you comes a long and basically gets to enjoy the ride. The lighting is perfect, the mood is crystal clear, and all you’re asked to do is pull the trigger. You probably felt like a character in a Nicolas Winding Refn film, not one of his employees. Yes, the Danish director of Drive and Valhalla Rising has certainly created a brand for himself and his characters. In fact, along with Only God Forgives, these three films could be described as his silent avenger trilogy. Only this time, there are two quiet forces exacting vengeance on one another – Julian (Ryan Gosling), a drug dealing Muay Thai boxer on a reluctant mission to avenge his slain bother, and Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), a sword-wielding police officer out to Kill Bill… or Julian, or whoever wronged him. As long as he makes a bloody disgusting point while doing it. In that sense, Pansringarm feels more like Winding Refn’s muse than Gosling. Regardless, both actors are essentially blunt instruments painted in bold, broad colours – just like the film as a whole.  The authorial continuity from Drive is unmistakable, but in Only God Forgives, it’s hard not to pick apart the director’s external influences. Winding Refn might have dedicated the film to avant-garde artist and cinematic shit-disturber Alejandro Jodorosky, but that feels more based on him being an emotional role model. I’m talking more about aesthetics. There’s the aforementioned Kubrickian symmetry and stillness to the framing, but also moments reminiscent of David Lynch’s hypnotic elliptical editing, Ingmar Bergman-esque dream sequences and David Cronenberg’s disturbing approach to sexualizing violence. Filmmakers are rarely mentioned in such respected company, but there’s a caveat. This film might be filled with striking and beautiful images, but it’s often feels soulless. It has the strange ability to walk the walk of an art film, but not talk the talk. The message is simply about how cool something can look. I know, you’re not complaining. As a still photographer, why would you? But as an audience member, I craved a little more to chew on. Cutting out excessive dialogue is a virtue more films should follow, but there’s a lack of characterization, social commentary or even subtext here to fill in the gaps. It’s essentially moving pictures strung together using the outline of a Greek tragedy via Bangkok. Don’t get me wrong – I rather enjoyed watching the whole thing, but mostly on the level of moving pictures. You understand.

I feel like I’m unqualified to provide a fair perspective on the new high school sex-comedy The To-Do List. Not because I don’t possess the necessary analytical faculties (clearly I don’t), and not because the thematic complexities of the film resist easy interpretation—it’s because I’m a dude, and how can a dude like me comment on the authenticity of a film that, even in its broadest, most absurd moments, seems to be revealing something heretofore unspoken about the sexual attitudes of teenage girls. If there’s anyone who knows something about the murky intersection of identity politics and sexual expression, it’s you. So let me ask you, Uncle Luke: am I allowed to say that The To-Do List is a mediocre flick? Or should I acknowledge that maybe I’m missing something. No, no. It’s not that the film is built to appeal to an (assumed) female sensibility in the way that, say, Pacific Rim is built to appeal to the (assumed) sensibilities of a pubescent Japanese male. It’s trickier than that. As rote and formulaic as The To-Do List often feels, there is, in that roteness and formula, a vague sense of something subversive happening. The premise and plot are the stuff of modern myth: high school senior, anxious about post-adolescence, makes conscious decision to gain multitudinous sexual experience in the summer before college. Except here that senior is a girl, a neurotic perfectionist played by Aubrey Plaza, who offsets her usual deadpan, zero-sum allure with a bit of cute and clownish bluster. And so it goes: she stalks a group of pervy boys and allows herself to be finger-blasted, dry-humped, and cunnilingized before eventually getting her chance with the chiseled, gold-skinned head lifeguard—only to realize that maybe sex isn’t as important as she thought. So on, so forth. That hint of subversion comes, I suppose, from the fact that we’re getting a girl’s-eye view of the post-grad sexathalon that has been a rite of passage for movieland teenagers since the early 80s. Indeed, first-time writer and director Maggie Carey (to whom I am crediting, maybe mistakenly, a significant measure of authorial intent) seems eager to subsume the common elements of the modern gross-out comedy: the awkward nudity, the spilling (in this case, spitting) of bodily fluids. But I don’t want to categorize her film as some sort of girl’s version of Superbad because, frankly, it’s not quite as funny, or self-immolating, or clever as Superbad. But I understand, too, that much of what I find funny and self-immolating and clever about Superbad – in particular the way that the film slowly, surreptitiously evolves into a panegyric about male friendship – is rooted in how much of the detail I find familiar, how much I identify with the characters and their universal (to me) struggle. There are probably a lot of details in The To-Do List that will very feel familiar to many female viewers. Probably. Maybe. In her essay on Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God, British author Zadie Smith writes of her initial resistance, as a precocious fourteen year-old, to liking the novel simply “because she’s black.” Smith observes: “White readers often believe they are colorblind…identification [is] so natural to white readers that they believe themselves above personal identification, or believe that they are only identifying only at the highest, existential levels…” This is true, too, of male moviegoers. The teenage boy’s perspective is the default mode for the high school sex comedy. Even a film like Fast Times At Ridgemont High – which was directed by Amy Heckerling and in a few terrific scenes manages to relay some uncomfortable truths about what it’s like to be a teenage girl (I think) – still feels, in its worldview, decidedly masculine.  But perhaps I’m answering my own question by introducing Zadie Smith as a variable.  When I read her novel On Beauty, wasn’t I moved, most of all, by Zora’s middle-child insecurities? Wasn’t the impressionistic third section of her latest novel NW, which follows Natalie Blake from childhood to adulthood (occasionally into some very unique forms of sexual experimentation), the very best, most empathetic thirty pages of prose I read last year? And aren’t Manhola Dargis and Dana Stevens two of the film critics whose opinions I value the most? Doesn’t it matter just as much to me what they have to say about Pacific Rim as what they’ll say about this picture? I don’t expect them to equivocate their judgments because they don’t identify with a pubescent kaiju-geek’s cosmological views in the same way I do. Why am I being so hard on myself? I suppose the difference is that The To-Do List doesn’t seem interested, as Zadie Smith is, in exploring larger issues of character or class. It is content, rather, to exist as an object, and, simply by existing, laying claim to the thesis that your most famous album so intrepidly articulated in its title: \"that girls, too, can be as nasty as they wanna be. Sorry, Luther. I’m sure you’re all like: why does this even concern me? Well, as you may know from the fine print on your royalty cheques, the elaborate opening credit sequence of film plays out over the beats of your recidivist 1989 hit “Me So Horny.” It’s a montage that emulates the awkward materialist nostalgia captured in the opening credits of Napoleon Dynamite, but gives us, instead, the detritus of early-90s youth culture: kaboodles and swatches and trapper-keepers and the like. When, in the final verse, Fresh Kid Ice asserts, “Put your lips on my dick, and suck my asshole too!” two things occurred to me: first, how shocking that line must have been when it was first uttered two decades ago (one almost sympathizes with Florida Judge Jose Gonzalez, who, in 1990, declared your album obscene and told record store owners, “if you sell it, you’re going to jail”); second, just how far the prevailing culture has come in its tolerance of casual sexual obscenity. Right now, the number one song on Billboard’s pop singles chart is Robin Thicke’s jaunty, melodic “Blurred Lines”, a mainstream pop hit that features lines like “must wanna get nasty,” “do it like it hurt,” and “I’ll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two”—all delivered in a sweet falsetto, like a Frankie Valli ballad, like the chorus of a Bee Gees song. Two spots behind it, at number three? Former child star Miley Cyrus’s minimalist dance tune “We Can’t Stop,” the self-conscious vulgarity of which defies description (you kind of just have to watch the video). How quaint “Me So Horny” sounds by comparison. Quaint, but still pretty catchy. It’s a concordance of everything great about the adolescence of rap music; the 4/4 time signature, the 808s and snares, the funky running bass-line. But it lacks the equivocation of these newer tunes. You guys tried a little too hard to be offensive, Luther; your demagoguery was all conspicuous and shit. The To-Do List makes this mistake, too, I think; it strives a little too much for gender parity, and so fails to be the smart, bawdy, feminist comedy it wants to be. There’s not a moment that feels as real and funny and frightening as Jennifer Jason Leigh losing her virginity on a dugout bench in Fast Times. But, still, I can’t help but come back to that feeling, sitting in the theater, that I was missing something—that there were certain moments that might have clicked with me if I had lived a different life, if I’d had my bikini top snatched off at the swimming pool, if I’d passed out drunk at a party and woken up with a boy on top of me, if I’d ever possessed that weird mix of power and powerlessness that every woman must eventually learn to wield. But I didn’t. So all I can say is that The To-Do List is a pretty mediocre flick.

Since collecting top honours at Sundance and Cannes, Fruitvale Station is undoubtedly on its way to wowing audiences and collecting prizes all over the world. And my most sincere congratulations to you specifically, Nina, for wading through what must have been some very tricky days at the casting office. I imagine your original casting call may have looked something like this: “Searching for Oakland area youths, male and female, early to mid-twenties, any race (though black applicants likely to be racially profiled and manhandled by police.) Based on true story…” Writer-Director Ryan Coogler’s first feature film is a dramatic recreation of the true story of 22-year old Oscar Grant’s fatal shooting by a police officer in the early hours of New Year’s Day, 2009. The incident took place at the Fruitvale Station on the Bay Area Rapid Transit Line in Oakland, California. There were many witnesses to the shooting, and it was even caught on video. Was your job easier, Nina, as a result of the wealth of resources that you could draw from? Here’s where your job wasn’t necessarily made any easier: a mere three and half years later, Coogler is filming on the very same ground as where the fatal shooting took place, and this in the heated aftermath of the case of Trayvon Martin’s fatal shooting at the hands of George Zimmerman… Talk about close to the bone in both time and place, it gives Apocalypse Now a run for it’s money. There, Coppola’s every effort to re-create accurately the atmosphere, character, and action of the Vietnam War undoubtedly stirred up some disquieting sensations locally. But getting back to Oakland in 2012, it’s precisely this physical, emotional, and topical proximity that gives the film such weight: by dancing between fact and dramatic re-enactment, in close time and place to the original incident, and with matters as sensitive as race relations, abuse of power, and the carriage of justice. It all makes for a tense and gripping experience. You were in charge of liaising with local talent, and populating the scenes. Coogler’s desire to set his scene where it all went down must have made for some pretty sensitive briefing and conversations. I’m thinking about where you were likely to have spent a good deal of time: the wonderfully poignant scenes of the train trips to and from the city. These are the moments that the film builds to. Here Oscar and his friends cram into a packed carriage and happily ride alongside gay, straight, black, Hispanic, and white passengers. They chat, joke, dance, and generally revel in life’s possibilities. It’s an ideal moment of peace through understanding. Later, on the ride back from the city, Oscar unfortunately snags on an unsettled score, and the situation steers toward the brutal place we already know it’s going — whether we like it or not. The actors playing the passengers were all alive when Oscar Grant was shot. Some of them surely take that same route through Fruitvale Station, and all of them know that on any other day, when the cameras and lights aren’t around, the same thing could happen again. Maybe this is why the film doesn’t start with the actors you cast, but instead with the actual cell phone footage of Oscar Grant’s shooting. It reminds us that the world we’re about to enter is nobody’s fantasy, that since Oscar Grant, Trayvon Martin was shot in the Florida suburbs, and that it will likely happen again unless we as a society stop being so quick to create villains out of stereotypes.

Your experience working on blockbusters like Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Night at the Museum certainly helped as well. But what surprised me most was that, despite the film’s being a relentless 3D visual extravaganza, your work didn’t detract from characters and plot. Contemporary teenage movies often rely on bombastic visual effects for entertainment with the end result soulless. How Sea of Monsters evaded that trap is intriguing. You seem to know when to kick back and let others do their thing. In this sequel to The Lightning Thief – the first adaptation of author Rick Riordan’s YA series Percy Jackson & the Olympians – you left room for director Thor Frudenthal to focus on young demigod Percy’s coming of age. This made the movie more powerful than its predecessor, in which meaning was lost. In Sea of Monsters, Percy embarks on a journey to find the Golden Fleece that could save Camp Half-Blood, a demigod training centre, from destruction by Hermes’ rebellious son Luke. Along the way, Percy and his band of young heroes test their powers and limitations; they face their demons and mature. Recurring are the travails of parent-child relations: Percy feels abandoned by his father the Sea God Poseidon, and Luke’s fury towards elusive Hermes pushes him to commit evil acts. Parents and young viewers will both relate to this topic. The film’s footing in Greek myth provided a golden opportunity for you and your crew to show off your talents. Magical Hippocampus, half-horse and half-fish, was impressive with dazzling pink and green scales that recalled a Monet water lily painting. The Oracle of Delphi was an original robot with incandescent eyes whose narration of the legend of Kronos – the King of the Titans who ate his own children – was told in a spellbinding stained-glass animated sequence. It was an ingenious way to tell a brutal story without getting too graphic. These clever circumventions of gratuitous violence are present throughout the film, making it totally kid-friendly.  But the film had some glitches. The Gray Sisters’ taxi stunts, for instance, were overwrought and interrupted the movie’s flow. Polyphemus, played by 6-foot-10 Acadian boxer Robert Maillet, was disappointing.  Supposed to be one of the film’s deadliest monsters, in the end his role was negligible. This was unfortunate since Maillet’s imposing stature and charisma made him perfect for the part. With these inconsistencies, the Percy Jackson film series has yet to show it can live up to mega-hits like Pirates of the Caribbean or Harry Potter. Claude, you were nonetheless able to create a world that was both fantastic and believable. You supported Frudenthal’s emphasis on the very relevant and relatable growing pains of teenage gods, which made Sea of Monsters more substantial than The Lightning Thief. The series is on the comeback trail; families should enjoy this latest edition.

You’re known for creating much more polished visions of the future for directors like Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg and James Cameron. After seeing Blomkamp’s debut feature, District 9, his South African aesthetic seemed to favour a more down-and-dirty approach. That’s hardly in line with the devices you designed for Blade Runner, Minority Report, and Aliens. But after actually watching Elysium, it all made sense. Your job was not to meld your sleek and shiny with Blomkamp’s dirt and grime, but to intentionally clash with it.  In this vision of a future Earth (2154 to be exact), humanity has been neatly divided into two groups: those who can afford to leave the dying planet, and those forced to stay behind and scrape out some sort of living. It seems pretty clear that your designs were used to create the Utopian environments of Elysium – like an orbiting space station that serves as the ultimate gated community – while Blomkamp focused on those left behind. It’s no coincidence that Elysium’s Earth feels a lot like District 9’s titular sector (which itself echoed the real slums of Johannesburg). Not to focus too much on plot machanics, but this neat divide works its way right down into the story and characters: Matt Damon as Max, an orphan raised on Earth who is trying to go straight after a life of crime. After a work accident leaves him deathly sick, he decides his only option is to do that “one last job” for the local crime lord so he can get himself an illegal shuttle to Elysium, and cure himself through its advanced medical technology. Jodie Foster, by contrast, Elysium’s Minister of Defense, who, as the most relentless Neighbourhood Watch coordinator ever, has made it her life mission to keep Elysium pure, no matter the cost.  As far as conflicts and social commentary go, this is pretty simple stuff. And, really, simple is kind of refreshing after a summer of convoluted self-seriousness. It was a smart move for Blomkamp to employ your skills to help make that clarity part of Elysium’s visual design as well.  Blomkamp’s overall design for the film, though, is not quite so simple. Along with his desire to make a social statement, Blomkamp also likes to blow things up. Well, blow people up, to be more specific. Like District 9, Elysium’s main cast members are an array of intricately-designed weaponry. I didn’t detect your hand here, Syd, as the guns, rocket launchers, and swords used owe more to games like Quake and Halo than anything else. Once these weapons started appearing, I sort of hoped Damon would wield his very own BFG before the credits rolled. Luckily, Blomkamp takes a simple approach to action. Some of the cinematography and editing is a bit on the chaotic for my liking, but the amount of action is just right. Instead of the more-is-more approach, in which character is lost in an orgy of impersonal effects and explosions, Elysium, like your designs, prefers clarity. The scale of the action is always small and personal, even when motivations are the basest possible. It makes all the difference. Investment in the outcome of a conflict will always win out over simply watching conflict, no matter the size of the effects budget. This conflict carries Elysium through its clunkier moments – including Foster’s performance. The slight French accent she gives Delacourt is distracting, and as a result, she comes off as stiff instead of determined. And when Max’s childhood friend Frey (Alice Braga) becomes a main part of the storyline, Blomkamp’s commentary becomes a little trite and neat. His reliance on too-cute flashbacks to hem as children nearly undermines Elysium’s momentum. Thankfully, Sharlto Copley, as a relentless mercenary hunting Max, keeps things moving. The clarity of vision does come through overall. And if Elysium feels a little too pleased with its not-terribly-deep commentary, at least we know that’s by design.  Looking upward, Casey Status: Standard delivery (3.5/5)"},{"title":"Planes","url":"/2013/08/14/planes","date":"2013-08-14 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Roger Tonry, Aerial Consultant, I’m so confused.

Anyone over the age of 8 is probably going to feel like they’re being talked down to. But come on. You know better than anyone that attracting adults matters. An intelligent joke here and there, a clever plot twist – anything to raise this unapologetically exploitive picture into something not so embarrassing. That’s the whole Playboy mantra. Unfortunately, that’s not what you were hired for. Which is even more confusing. Somewhere along the way you obviously learned something about aerial photography. Makes sense – there’s only so many ways to shoot naked centerfolds before you need to get really creative.  So I’m happy to report that the aerial perspectives in Planes are actually my favourite part of the film. Weeee! In some of the training sequences for this (painfully uninspired) race-around-the-world underdog story, the point-of-view holds long enough to feel like we’re really following those exaggerated curves of a mountain or soft contours of a hill. Hmm. I wonder where the inspiration for that came from. There’s just not much else here to enjoy. A few plane puns made me smirk, but never resulting in anything as drastic as a smile. And I have a kid now, I should be open to this stuff. But the advance screening of Elysium was playing in the room right next door, dammit.

Scott, Teenager #3, Five middle-aged men walk into a pub— No, that isn’t a start of a lame joke. It’s the start of the wildest Friday night the town of Newton Haven has ever seen.  And also the beginning of the third installment in Edgar Wright’s Cornetto trilogy. So, five middle-aged men walk into a pub, on a mission to complete a pub crawl they started twenty years earlier. Having drifted apart over the years, they find themselves in their forties with a whack of unresolved issues, and are trying to recapture a bit of the optimism and promise of their youth. Here’s the thing about adults, Luke. There comes a point where they spend a lot of time looking back. They remember how dynamic and fearless they were in their younger days, and lament the loss of that fearlessness that comes with the onset of adult life, responsibilities, achy joints, the filling out, the slowing down, etc. It can all get a bit maudlin, so it’s nice to have a distraction. Like wondering if or how they will live through the night.  As the five roll up and start cutting a path of destruction down the Golden Mile, their antics might get repetitive to the point where one starts to question why a town needs twelve pubs when five would have been sufficient to get the point across. Luckily, though, our five heroes aren’t the only ones who have changed. They notice the townsfolk are acting very weird. Creepy weird. And there’s beer involved. Things get real messy, real fast. While I am madly impressed that you and your fellow young actors did your own stunt work, I was most taken by the film’s refusal to indulge in too much mid-life crisis navel gazing. The actors have their moments of lamentation, but it’s in the subsequent scenes of mad aggression in which they really shine. There’s a clear catharsis when a lethargic, soft-middled dad pile-drives someone into the ground. A palpable moment of self-actualization when they rip the head off someone else. Bathed in gooey blue blood (by the way, gross) and a gooey sense of camaraderie, these aging friends are able to face the end of everything with a special kind of dignity. As the townspeople of New Haven, you and your fellow background players give the stars a run for their money.

The heat of summer is dissipating. August has waned and yet another disappointing season of blockbusters has come to an ignominious close. Ahead of us sprawls the barren, hopeless wasteland of the September release schedule. It’s that time of year when, to soothe our assailed senses, we here on this side of the Atlantic look to foreign lands for the sort of mature, coherent, adult films that Hollywood (in particular) and America (in general) seem incapable of producing anymore. Still, who would have thought that the summer’s most bad-ass action hero wouldn’t be Tony Stark and his army of Iron Men, or Matt Damon in his dystopian exo-suit, or Ryan Gosling kick-boxing his way through the Bangkok underworld, but rather a slight Danish business executive in a red-striped power-tie  The character you play – Peter C. Ludvigsen, the corporate CEO whose protracted negotiations with a group of Somali pirates make for much of the action in A Hijacking – is both steelier and more manly than this summer’s other Man of Steel. Cold calculation, stony consideration; in the great early scene that sets up Ludvigsen’s prowess as a negotiator (he walks out on a group of Japanese businessmen) we learn everything we need to know about how he expresses his confidence and asserts control. And it’s those very qualities that are challenged throughout the movie. There’s a difference between stillness and restraint. It’s something that Ryan Gosling sometimes has trouble distinguishing. But you really get it, Soren. The intensity you generate doesn’t come from what is implicitly unsaid, but from the physical exertion of not saying it. Writer and director Tobias Lindholm understands this, too. Your performance is like a tonal metronome; when other actors cry out, get angry, break down, the magnitude of it is measured against the harmonic mean of your character’s mood. If the cramped meeting room with whiteboards and speakerphones and empty takeout containers is where the action takes place, then the suspense is generated shipboard, where the cargo vessel’s skeleton crew is held captive in cramped quarters. The ambiguousness of their relationship with their captors is more terrifying than any high-concept, stringy-haired ghost-lady horror flick released this year: one moment they’re celebrating a caught fish with a birthday song for one of the hostage’s daughters, in the next moment that same hostage has the muzzle of a rifle pressed against his head for no other reason than to scare the shit out of him. And it does. And it scares us, too. This is what restraint and patience earns you: the kind of deeply-felt anxieties and thrills that genre pictures – machines, essentially, built to quickly and efficiently deliver those anxieties and thrills – don’t seem, any longer, to aspire to.   Tillykke, Jared Young  Status: Priority Post (4.5/5)  "},{"title":"JOBS","url":"/2013/08/21/jobs","date":"2013-08-21 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Matt Whiteley, Screenwriter, With no previous screenwriting credits, you must have thought the biopic would be a pretty easy way to get through your first feature-length script. You don’t even have to make anything up! A trip to your local bookstore, a couple hours on Wikipedia and the first draft practically writes itself. Just highlight your favorite bits and fill in the rest with that “conflict” stuff writers are always talking about. A fabled rise-to-riches, an obligatory fall-from-grace, a redemptive return to glory and you’ve got a formula that would have Blake Snyder patting your back from the great beyond. Unfortunately, based on the way Jobs turned out, it may not have been the paint-by-numbers exercise you imagined. But you sure did try. It should have been a fool-proof recipe. You have a lead character with all the necessary traits of a great cinematic protagonist. A charismatic (but misunderstood) hippy-genius assembles a group outcast stereotypes to build a futuristic supermachine in his mom’s garage. With acid-driven arrogance, he convinces a rich has-been to back him financially and then actually makes good thanks to the sweat others and a little OCD. Seemingly overnight, the personal computer is on everyone’s 80’s Christmas list. He gets rich, throws a temper tantrum, and stabs his friends in the back only to be fired by a team of scheming corporate cutouts. Fast forward a few years, (the boring garden-tending ones) he’s found inner peace, shaved his beard and limps around in a halo of holy light that seems to provide him with a never-ending supply of inspirational analysis. The evil stooges have since learned the error in their ways and beg our hero to return. Only he can save the company. How satisfying it is when he colors the new computer machine with a blue felt pen and then goes on to create the world’s best discman. This is, of course, a quick and irreverent recount of your quick and irrelevant retelling of the life of Steve Jobs, founder of the world’s most profitable public company and creator of the device you’re likely reading this on. Your version begins in his scruffy college days, takes us quickly through the rise of Apple and into his untimely departure. It all moves at a breakneck pace that just seems to be checking boxes rather than examining themes. We never truly spend enough time with Jobs to understand his method or his madness. You touch briefly on his enigmatic personality and questionable ethics just long enough to numb our interest in his success or rally behind his legendary return. By the time we reach the film’s conclusion, he’s manifested a zen-like persona without the audience having any sense of how he got there. What’s left is the Disney-fied rendering of a famous misanthrope – and it’s forgivable because he’s an undeniable genius who built some pretty neat things. Biographic interpretation can only ever be revered or reviled. There’s no in-between. The lone fact that you’re even writing a film about someone’s life means they’ve gone out and put dent in the universe so large that your pen was gravitationally pulled to the paper. Regurgitating someone’s entire existence in a series of bullet points comes with the kind of baggage fanboys refuse to check at the gate. It’s the kind of offering that will be ceaselessly and unapologetically scrutinized. Forever. Once the dust settles, if your paper is ever drawn to pen again, maybe try something a little less irresponsible. Like fiction. It’s not all bad. The music supervision deserves a note of praise for putting together a collection of relevant period classics. And Josh Gad’s Steve Wozniak, is a lovable comic foil, engaging enough in at least one scene to generate a bit of genuine empathy. And, for what it’s worth, the film’s fault’s aren’t completely yours. You only drafted the blueprint. Someone else steered the ship into the iceberg. The emotional telegraphing (single tears shed, or late night car ride featuring screams in frustration) just can’t be forgiven. And let’s not forget the overabundance of inspirational music cues or the awful opening montage in the acid field. (He’s, like, tripping on his own mind music, man.) You should take solace knowing that when all is said and done, you will have successfully dodged the harshest of all bullets in the shooting gallery of criticism. That shot will land square in the heart Chris “Ashton” Kutcher playing Michael Kelso’s pantomime of the late Steve Jobs. Remember when he glued on that beard, studied a keynote and then gestured his way through a sketch performance for two hours? This casting choice was abysmal before it was announced and goes to show that similarities in appearance are never a justifiable replacement for good acting. It remains to be seen whether audiences are actually interested in a biopic about a paradigm-shifting tech geek. Rumors put Aaron Sorkin’s version in theaters some time next year. You were first to market, and as Steve said, there is an advantage to being first. But, like so many of our hero’s failed wares, you still run the very real risk that no one wants your product.

That’s a phrase nobody involved in a porno ever wants to hear—even back in the 70s. Same thing applies to a film that’s about making porn in the ‘70s. It just ruins the magic. Kills the vibe. Makes the whole thing feel forced. Frankly, if someone has to say it: you’re doing a sloppy job. The good news is, I never once noticed your teeth. You performed like a pro. Just like Linda Lovelace in the X-rated blockbuster Deep Throat. Which also worries me— were you horrifically taken advantage of, too? Hey, it’s possible. With so many stars on set, who’s to say you weren’t pressured to do a few favours on the side? Maybe a courtesy polish for Amanda Seyfried, who was probably looking for any excuse to smile after recreating the abuse and rape that her character endured in real-life? Maybe James Franco needed some help scraping the residual plaque from his Spring Breakers grill to portray Hugh Hefner? Maybe Peter Sarsgaard begged for a total orthodontic reconstruction so he’d never have to portray another snaggle-toothed creep ever again? The stories you must have! I can hardly wait for your inevitable tell-all book that reveals everything that went on behind the scenes of Lovelace. I expect you’ll take the lead of co-directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman by telling us the whole tale the way we expect it happened. It will be an artistic rendition, with straightforward but pleasing cinematography, well-designed period details and comfortable pacing that allows the characters to feel like the flesh-and-blood counterparts they’re portraying. The first half of the story will only hint at the mistreatment. Then, at the midway point, we can go back to fill in the gaps and see how glossed-over the first story really was. This is the most fascinating aspect of Lovelace. But the problem is, like a set of dentures, no matter how accurate the molds and fittings they’re still artificial. The film never acknowledges Lovelace’s tendency to contradict her own statements, her pendulous back-and-forth swing in and out of the feminist movement, and it certainly fails to mention her involvement in the bestiality film Dogarama that preceded Deep Throat (I guess there are some cavities best left unfilled). So get to work. If Deep Throat could make $600M dollars, I’m sure you can cash in on the public’s oral fixation too.

After a couple years in the business, I’m sure you’re beginning to get the hang of things. You know, run an R-Bass sub-harmonic enhancer to beef up production dialogue and EQ the room out of a track – the basics. In a World…, the new flick you worked on with Lake Bell – which she wrote, directed, and stars in – takes place in the present, but not, it seems, the present that we live in. Some alternate dimension, rather, where the art of the trailer didn’t evolve to favor earnest montages and driving beats. Where Don LaFontaine’s famous ice-breaker, from which the film gets its title, yet holds enough cultural relevance to change a young woman’s life. Do you ever wish that you were born a few decades earlier so that you could have been around for the golden age of the voice-actor? The same way, say, that young writers look back reverentially to the glory days of publishing in postwar New York, or young filmmakers might dream of travelling back to the early 70s to hang out with Scorsese and Spielberg and Lucas and Kasdan at their crash-pad on Nicholas Beach. Because, yes, the era of the omniscient and authoritative V/O certainly seems to be ebbing. Jeff Bridges is narrating Energizer commercials, Matt Damon is the voice of TD Ameritrade, and even in the depressing world of low-cost corporate videos there’s a clear bias towards more authentic, conversational, “real” voices. Or maybe it does take place in our world. You run with that crowd now—you tell me. Maybe this is less an alternate dimension and more of a quick glimpse into a cloistered Hollywood subculture. Whatever the case, the trick that Bell had to turn – finding a way to fit her cutesy rom-com plot, which follows the daughter of a notable (and misogynistic) voice-actor as she breaks gender barriers and finds love, into this weird, byzantine universe – is a trick of tone and consistency. Something that you’re probably familiar with: getting the levels right. And Bell manages it, for the most part. The absurdity is dialed up, the quirkiness is equalized. But it’s the relationships – between father and daughter, husband and wife, mentor and mentee – that sit at the top of the mix and provide a richness of feeling that is, I guess, somewhat surprising for a movie that reaches its climax at the Golden Trailer Awards.  “Reaches its climax”?

A little brushed to the side, perhaps? Cate Blanchett’s role is being praised from here to the hilltops and rightly so, but this film’s beauty is in it’s contrasts. And Sally, your role as Ginger, warm, robust and earthy to Cate’s delicate, particular flower, Jasmine, is essential. Without the golden and orange hues Ginger and her family bring to the mix, Blue Jasmine could so easily have been, true to its name, a very blue, woeful melodrama. When we meet Jasmine she’s living the high-life travelling first class, wearing a mish-mash of high-end designers and speaking on and on about her fantastic life while she waits with her fellow passenger for her Louis Vuitton luggage. But this is an illusion that is quickly shattered. Jasmine’s broke and, after a mental breakdown, not just in the monetary sense. She’s been electro-shocked and if squeezed could spit Xanax pills machine-gun style. Yet no matter the severity of her breakdown or the alarming number of trespasses her former husband took against her, we’re given no doubt that Jasmine did this to herself. Even though Hal, her ex-husband, was running some sort of Ponzi scheme whilst dilly-dallying with an assortment of younger women, Jasmine turned a blind-eye, as it suited her. The IRS having now taken all her money, Jasmine’s forced to turn to San Francisco and Ginger, her adopted sister. Although it seems she is unable to face reality. Her delusions are many and she’s really only interested in herself. But while Jasmine’s cracking up the light-hearted jazzy-blues soundtrack and sumptuous visuals of Ginger’s warm home and Jasmine’s luxurious former lifestyle keep this from becoming a maudlin affair. As does the comic lack of sophistication in Ginger’s love affairs compared to Jasmine’s; although Ginger is at least true to herself while Jasmine spins lie after lie.   So Sally, while Cate provides the emotional breakdown in this character study, Ginger and yourself provide the heart and anchor. Your character is the reason we care for this pampered and deluded soul, because Ginger does, and Jasmine seems to have some desire to help her sister, no matter how misinformed and misjudged her designs. It’s a relationship which will no doubt lead to Blanchett thanking you in her Oscar acceptance speech. Not that it’s too early to judge these things or anything.

Considering this movie frustrated me with a lot of unanswered questions, at least your film score was right up my alley. Punched up in the right spots to create suspense. Dark when it needed to be to invoke some fear. But more importantly, you weren’t afraid of using a little levity with the addition of some clever music to help hold the pieces together for such a thinly told story.  I quite enjoyed the soundtrack that is cued by the first encounter with the animals.  A little pre-story, if you will, of a man (neighbour of the Davison’s that we’re about to meet) and his young lover, which ends with the threat (and title) You’re Next scrawled on the wall.  And, weren’t you lucky that your director was able to get the rights to “Looking For The Magic” by the Dwight Twilley Band.  You used it very effectively to keep bringing us back to that first, seemingly random, murder scene.  Then you really ramped it up with the family dinner, the first of many unfortunate accidents, and all the bloodshed that ensued.  Thanks to you and your creative score, I kept my head in the game.  You held my interest, and kept me caring about the characters and story — however one dimensional everything was in the end. And, all this despite You’re Next feeling like a story I’d seen before; the random home invasion, the masked men, the ultraviolence, the dark humour, etc.  It felt a little like Strangers, but with a higher fun and slasher factor.  If it weren’t for my love of this genre – and your self-aware score –  I probably would have been bored to tears. However, walking out of the theatre after You’re Next, I was left with some burning questions, or at least that feeling of nodding along to a catchy pop song with lyrics that don’t quite make sense. I mean, who is the main character of this story?   I get that Crispian made the big decision, and certainly orchestrated everyone to visit the folks for dinner, but ultimately Erin is the one who decided to fight back against a mob of animal masked home invaders.  You’re Next really becomes her film in the end, whether that’s logical or not, it got the story told in a new way. And, speaking of logic: What the hell is wrong with Crispian’s family anyway? And why were the bad guys so ill equipped to handle what boils down to essentially one able bodied woman? And more generally, when do you think it’s appropriate to tell your partner about your past?  Especially an interesting past, full of great adventure stories? One that would equip a woman to handle herself in any situation… I’m getting off track, aren’t I? How about you just tell me what soundtrack I could use to get into Erin’s fighting shape.

One bad connection and the whole thing dies. In film, the thriller genre works the same way. Comedies or action films can sometimes get away with narrative gaps that magically lead to big explosions or big laughs, but an effective thriller needs to be more conscientious of the physical world. And most importantly, we absolutely need to get a charge out of the ending. So let’s go back and figure out where your latest film Closed Circuit broke down. We open on a crowded London market, where a series of split-screen cameras allow us to watch multiple interactions at once. The sound ebbs and flows between characters, forcing our eyes to jet around the screen until more and more frames focus on a mysterious truck. And then – kaboom. The execution of this first sequence is engaging, authentic feeling, appropriately disorienting and perfectly effective. It’s also a wonderful use of London’s ubiquitous closed circuit cameras, from which the film actually gets its name (sorry if I got your hopes up). But that verité style is almost immediately dropped and Closed Circuit quickly becomes a rather standard, barely passable political drama that loses most of the power it produced in the opening. One of the main sources of energy relies on the “special” relationship between Eric Bana and Rebecca Hall’s characters. Although both are on the same defense team, only she, as Special Advocate, has access to Top Secret information in the “closed” section of the trial. It’s hardly to her benefit, however, as Bana’s character pieces more of the puzzle together anyway, and soon the distance they are required by law to keep becomes a non-issue to the plot. There don’t seem to be many consequences for breaking the rules, and the story just keeps on flowing. For the most part, the film has enough juice to overcome these small logic deficiencies and even some uninspired double-agent character reveals. But by the end, there is just no real payoff. No big light goes off that makes sitting through all the plotting and maneuvering worth it. And worst of all, I think the filmmakers knew it. The audio montage that ends Closed Circuit feels like a strange and dishonest after-thought tacked on to a story that obviously had no intention of providing simple closure. And that approach, as you know, is bound to fail if it’s not handled right.

I mean, if director Wong Kar Wai felt that way when he made Ashes of Time, it stands to reason that he and Hung would reunite for The Grandmaster – his first martial arts epic since that film.  But a lot has happened since 1994. Namely, The Matrix, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and Kill Bill Vols. 1 and 2. The past 15 or so years have seen you become the go-to guy for Hollywood martial arts choreography. So when Wong started on this biography of the legendary Ip Man, you must have been an obvious choice. The fact that Hung had himself choreographed the action for a previous Ip Man biopic (called, appropriately enough, Ip Man) may have also been an influence, as Wong likes to give his films a unique looks and moods. Of course you must have known that while The Grandmaster would show how Ip Man helped popularize and democratize Chinese martial arts, it would certainly not be your standard martial arts film. Wong is too interested in people—faces, to be specific—to focus too long on the action. Don’t get me wrong, your work is on fine display here. When the action comes, it’s at once furious and poetic. But Wong adds a layer of abstraction to the fights with his signature stylistic flourishes that break the action into smears of colour and light. And those faces. As much as anyone working today, Wong certainly understands the power of a close-up. Anchoring the narrative with stars as beautiful as Tony Leung and Ziyi Zhang doesn’t hurt, either. Leung, as Ip Man, and Zhang, as Gong Err, give the film its shape as romantic might-have-beens, their relationship illustrated over a series of encounters that mostly span the Second Japanese Sino War. Both martial arts masters, Ip and Gong initially meet as rivals, engaging in a playful fight that combines your graceful choreography and Wong’s emotional intensity in an erotically charged dance. As he showed in 2000’s In the Mood for Love, Wong knows that it’s often what’s not said—or acted upon—that packs the biggest punch. Surrounding this central relationship, there are other more traditional showcases for your work. Ip, for example, engages masters of different marital arts disciplines in his quest to create greater respect for Wing Chun, the (at the time) little-known style he teaches. All of these encounters, romantic or combative, are structured as narrative way points with very direct onscreen titles that fill in the gaps between scenes. Because this version of The Grandmaster has been recut (by Wong himself) specifically to help Western audiences through some of the less familiar elements of Chinese history, these titles (which cover some major events in Ip’s life) have a matter-of-factness that contrasts with the deep emotions of what does play out onscreen. Or maybe the emotional intensity is raised because of this contrast. Whatever the reason, as ungainly as it sounds, it works. Like the ways Ip is constantly called on to prove his backwoods style is the equal of more the established fighting forms, The Grandmaster’s form shows that art comes from the unlikeliest of combinations.

Just as easy as learning the most complicated aspects of camera circuitry, computer programming, civil engineering, international trade policies, and top-secret security banking protocols—all without any planning ahead! Or maybe Getaway is blowing more hot air than a centrifugal super-charger on a ’68 Chevy Chevelle. Except all that exhaust is coming out of Selena Gomez, playing the most obnoxious co-star since Jar Jar Binks.  Gomez (who never gets a character name) is introduced to us through the context of a completely implausible car jacking, pulling a gun on Ethan Hawk’s character.

You and your team have a great excuse for covering the car in cameras and frantically cutting between shots, but somehow, Brian, that doesn’t make the action any more exciting. Looking at the same problems from different angles doesn’t inherently offer you a solution, just another view of what’s wrong. To make matters worse, a simple tune-up – re-casting Gomez or tweaking a few character choices – wouldn’t quite do the trick. This story is built like those rocket-shaped super cars that only drive in a straight line and need a parachute to stop. No consideration has been put into maneuvering around plot points or appealing to the average moviegoer. It’s all go, all the time, like the filmmakers are afraid that slowing down will give the audience time to think. As a result, we just feel detached and unsatisfied as the one-track story barrels ahead. There’s a reason the Fast and Furious movies are so successful, and it sure isn’t because they only appeal to gear-heads like you.

The movie’s real-life inspiration – an African-American butler who served eight presidents – had an insider’s view on some of 20th Century America’s most important historical events, and Daniels is able to revel in them. The film has a star-laden cast led by America’s most powerful woman, Oprah Winfrey, and it offers the Academy an embarrassment of riches with which it might reverse its disgraceful lack of minority nominations.  You should be able to coast through until the Oscar ceremony, right? Except this may be an uphill battle. There’s the story, for one thing: your fictional Cecil Gaines has little in common with the real-life Eugene Allen, beyond that they were both White House butlers and both went to a Reagan-era state dinner.  Daniels and screenwriter Danny Strong have decided that Cecil Gaines, ably played by Forest Whitaker, needs a tragic childhood to haunt him and an activist son (David Oyelowo) to clash with. Early on, Gaines learns that he must wear two faces: one for his white employers and another for his family and friends.  This duality is a powerful idea to explore, but it’s not something so much explored as explained to us, repeatedly, in voiceover. That voiceover, Harvey!  Whitaker has every reason to expect a nomination for his work here, except that his own narration undercuts his performance at every turn, telegraphing his epiphanies and evolution. The other actors fare better.  Winfrey tears into her role, not quite dimming her charisma, but never allowing her Oprah-ness to overwhelm. She does her best work in close-ups or acting against Terence Howard as her smarmy neighbour, though struggles mightily to wrestle with a script that has her use the occasion of JFK’s assassination to complain about her husband needing to spend more time at home. The movie really comes alive in the smaller moments – at house parties, or Gaines joking in the kitchen with the other staff – and I would have loved more of that insider’s view, in the vein of West Wing or Downton Abbey. But there’s always a new presidential impersonation to wonder at. There’s the rebellious son, Louis, turning up to bring to the forefront whatever is going on politically at the moment. There is one wonderful sequence, of Louis and his fellow activists taking part in a lunch counter sit-in, and the abuse they suffer is intercut with a formal White House dinner; it’s further intercut with scenes of the activists preparing—role-playing, wondering what will happen to them.  It’s marvelous both for its energy and the way it conveys just how much work went into the civil rights movement. We feel, both viscerally and intellectually, how hard-won those changes were, and how wide a gulf existed between Cecil Gaines’ two worlds.  That’s your Oscar moment right there, Harvey. (Just make sure you remove the scene in which Louis slams Sidney Poitier from the screener—that’s not something the Academy will forgive.)

I want to talk about a single shot in Prisoners: the dolly movement towards the tree. Remember? It’s in the first 15 minutes of the film. You must have been thinking, what’s the point of this shot? Nothing happens, we’re just moving in on a tree. But then the disconcerting score comes in. And the colour is graded to perfection. And a story slowly unfolds around it. And a simple transition shot becomes just as powerful, tense, and unforgettable as the rest of the film. Frankly, a shot like is only effective because, to Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, every detail matters. There is nothing superfluous or haphazard in his carefully curated universe. He’s proven it in each of his feature films, from Un 32 août sur terre, to Maelström, to Polytechnique, to Incendies.  Now, in his Hollywood debut, he has taken a story that sounds like a formulaic movie-of-the-week drama – the search for two missing girls – and turned it into a first-rate emotional thriller. With plenty of help, granted, from you and your boss, 10-time Oscar nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins (recent winner of The Roger Deakins Award for Excellence in Being Roger Deakins). The cast also deserves credit. Hugh Jackman plays one of the missing girls’ fathers, alongside Terrence Howard, and, in the course of the film, comes to feel rather strongly that the lead detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) is not doing his job. In most director’s hands, Jackman’s character would dominate the story and be shot in the frenetic shaky cam-style with which Paul Greengrass has almost ruined Hollywood pictures. But Villeneuve knows better. He understands how restraint builds energy. His reveals are slow and steady. And the deeper we push into the story, the more it becomes a morality tale.There’s a puzzle motif within the film, but the emotional through-line is very straight—and even more powerful than the mystery. The characters go off the rails, but the storytelling never falters. Bruce, you’ve all made a picture that’s as moving as, well, a dolly shot. It’s smooth, beautiful, haunting and locked into its tracks – completely confident about where’s it going. I enjoyed the ride so much (even at a run time of two and a half hours) that I was almost sad to see things finally resolve. But luckily, not at all unsatisfied.

You worked on Godfather III and Hannibal, two other movies that had to work hard to try to deal with the expectations of their predecessors. People get all nervous and wonder if they are doing the right thing. Unlike those other two examples, though, the second outing of the badass anti-hero was considered a high point. For Richard B. Riddick, the second movie was considered a misstep for both the director and the main character. This movie is meant to be a return to form. And the result is nice. It’s not great, and it’s not terrible. Riddick has its heart in the right place and leather everywhere else. Especially the pants. That’s why I thought your work was interesting here. When we meet our hero again, he is in the midst of a character- and wardrobe-malfunction. It picks up where Chronicles of Riddick left off, where he has beaten the Necromongers (death sellers? What’s their customer base? Is that why they seem so unhappy?) and become their leader. And now things have gone wrong. He is alone on a hostile planet, seems to have twisted his ankle, and is probably dying in his hunky metal armor. How did this happen? The flashback shows us a Tigger without his bounce. Riddick is a mopey and sullen necro-leader, (even during orgies, poor muffin) and he wonders what to do next. The costuming reflects this well, with agile and stealthy Riddick constrained by metal pants. He realizes his error and gets back to his strengths – stealthy killing, being tough, and not talking much. This also means taking off his rigid pants and making new ones out of things that he has killed – some alien leather that I am sure was your handiwork. It works. I believed the transformation. Next, he makes a plan to get off the planet by leveraging his wanted status and dislike of mercenaries. We get to see Riddick at his best: alone and outnumbered against very bad people and monsters. And it works, for the most part. He does all the cool Riddick things, trying to make honest deals with people, all of whom seem to be much more crooked than he’s supposed to be. He sees in the dark. He sneaks. He’s misunderstood. He punches! He gets captured! The story doesn’t all make sense, and the death and betrayal gets too predictable. Why doesn’t Riddick ever learn?  But it’s good fun if you enjoyed the others. I could warn you about some clunky writing, too much CGI and some ugly choices right out of 80s action movie, but somehow I don’t think that would bother you – being the leather pants guy, and all.

It certainly is a clever word, evoking memories of such classic satires as Airplane and The Naked Gun. Heck, perhaps your agent even pitched this project to you as a sharp-witted, Zucker Brothers-style parody of this summer’s blockbuster Pacific Rim. Regardless of whatever duplicitous means were employed to bring you on board, the production’s true nature must have come as quite a shock. I don’t want to come off as needlessly antagonistic, so I won’t ask what it was like for you, a former Oscar-nominated actor, to realize that you were starring in the type of low-budget rip-off that exists solely to piggyback off the success of a bigger hit (or to trick people into purchasing what they think is the real McCoy). But believe me when I say this, man: you are far, far and away the best thing about Atlantic Rim. I’ve thought long and hard about how best to describe your performance. But even now, days after viewing the “film,” I can’t find the words. Your demeanor onscreen seems to suggest that you find the material completely unworthy of your time (and rightly so), yet somehow you’re simultaneously giving it your very all. In other words, it seems as if you care, but also don’t care at all. This duality makes your character, a fairly stock military officer, absolutely fascinating to watch. In nearly every scene you look as if you’d rather be somewhere else (possibly throttling your agent), and you bark out your lame-brained dialogue (“Pipe down, guys!”) with little discernible enthusiasm. But there’s a something indefinable behind your eyes that keeps your character, against all odds (and, boy, are there some long odds), weirdly compelling. If only your fellow actors had decided to follow in your footsteps, then Atlantic Rim might have been a far more tolerable experience. Clearly they were aware of the film’s quality (or lack thereof), and instead of playing it straight we have to watch them struggling to hide smiles; a sort of unpleasant self-awareness that, in David Chokachi’s case, makes the audience curse their ability to both see and hear (you must have showed some truly admirable restraint while interacting with him on the set—unless there are some choke slam/backhanding incidents that have yet to be made public). Unfortunately, the filmmakers seemed oblivious to the miraculous quality of your performance, and they drop the ball in a big way in the third act. For a film that so shamelessly apes Pacific Rim’s core concepts – aquatic monsters rising to wreak havoc on the surface world, experimental robots with a neurological link to their military pilots (or in Chokachi’s case, a neurological link to alcoholic frat-boy douchebags) – the one thing writer Thunder Levin decided to steer clear from was having the leader of the operation – your character –  suit up to take part in the climatic final battle. A poor choice, I think, especially since your character is given precious little to do in the previous hour of the movie besides staring at computer monitors and yelling at people wearing eye patches. If only you had been allowed to take part in the movie’s climax, maybe then the ten-minute-long “spectacle” of Rock-‘Em Sock-‘Em Robots zipping through the air and swatting at a dragon with what appear to be giant stop signs might have gained some degree of excitement or emotion or humor.

A producer. A cinematographer. A make-up artist, production manager, sound recorder, assistant editor, carpenter, costumer, runner, wrangler, and more. In your many roles, you represent no less than 50% of the people who worked on The Act of Killing. And in every case, you are remarkably brave. Because you were never just a disposable crewmember, risking your life for someone else’s crazy vision. You’re also a father. A mother. A son. A sister. A friend. And most importantly, a human being – even if we don’t know your name. So above all, thank you, for helping tell this strangest of stories and contributing to one of the most important documentaries ever made. Where do I even start? Few films have ever made me feel so… much. Angry, horrified, mesmerized, baffled, shocked, confounded, and, ultimately, inspired. Over the past week, I’ve found myself retelling countless scenes to friends, colleagues and even strangers, as way of convincing them to see this film. I’ll describe to them some of the most bizarre moments in full detail in my own recreation of the experience – including what happened and what I was thinking. But it’s only now, in this moment, that I am realizing why that testament to the film’s power is so profoundly ironic. As you know all too well, the Indonesian government supported paramilitary troops in the genocidal extermination of communists, communist supporters, and ethnic Chinese in 1965 and 1966. Driven by horribly graphic propaganda films, a calculated campaign was carried out by everyone from gangsters to journalists to murder without mercy and rape without remorse. Now, some 50 years later, we’re told many Indonesians have forgotten this great “triumph”. So in 2012, films were commissioned to recreate the massacres, with additional encouragement to elevate the experience through artistic interpretation, be it Bollywood musical or Hollywood Western. But The Act of Killing is not some thoughtless collection of those films. Instead, because of you, we get to go behind the scenes of that experience in a documentary that becomes a multi-layered examination of the power of film. The main murderer/national hero we follow in the film is a seemingly unassuming, gentle-natured man named Anwar Congo. In an early scene, he describes how using a wire was his method of choice for killing nearly 1,000 people. He pantomimes the sequence for your documentary team with matter-of-fact detail. A few scenes later, we see him review the footage at home, with clear discomfort on his face. He’s clearly upset about what he’s seeing – not the description of horrific acts, but the fact he wore white pants the day of the shoot (he prefers dark colours). It’s chilling, and revelatory, but luckily for us (and you, especially), only the beginning of his incredibly complex journey back into the past. I’ll spare you from re-living anything else, since the film does a masterful job showing how the simple act of recreation can send people into full trauma. But I want people to see this film. We need people to see this film. But will anyone simply take my word for it? I hope so.

For this sequel, you and director James Wan have decided to admirably answer the questions left by the predecessor’s cliffhanger ending. Unfortunately, whereas Insidious’ spooky and minimalist style understood the “less is more” approach to filmmaking, Insidious: Chapter 2 seems to head towards the same fate as the Friday the 13th and Final Destination series, getting sillier with each chapter. The original intent of the first film could end up getting more lost than it already has in this first sequel. In the first movie, young Dalton finds himself trapped in the Further, a land of tormented souls who sought to use his body as a vessel to the outside world. The less effective moments in Insidious are when the demons and monsters are shown up close. Keeping them in the shadows and mostly off-screen followed the rules that sometimes what we don’t see is often times scarier than what is in our face. Unfortunately, instead of horror, the resulting sensation is closer to camp. In Insidious: Chapter 2, the evil beings get a lot of screen time, shouting at the characters and popping up, trying to produce one jump scare after another. Adding to the extended silliness, Insidious’ two comic relief ghost hunters return and are given more to do, resulting in a number of scenes that desperately try to be funny. Patrick Wilson seems to be channeling Jack Nicholson’s performance in The Shining with none of the terror, but all of the hysterics. I especially want to know why Rose Byrne’s role as Renai has been downgraded in the sequel. There are long periods where she is not on screen, which is a shame considering Byrne perfectly portrayed the part of a scared and worried mother in Insidious. One of the best scenes in Chapter 2 is when Renai’s baby is taken by one of the ghosts; it’s the rare moment here that actually creates an element of fear on-screen. One of the few other things that work is the inventive way this connects to the first film. Chapter 2 is certainly a sequel where watching the earlier movie is required and it was a fun and clever element going back to certain scenes. While the first Insidious obviously took some lessons from Alfred Hitchcock on how to build suspense and terror in an audience, Chapter 2 is instead nothing more than a haunted house ride and — not a particularly entertaining one at that. This runs the risk of turning into the Friday the 13th series, where character development and genuine scares are replaced with cheap thrills. When the inevitable third chapter of Insidious is made, I hope it is an expansion of the first one and not another exercise in self-parody, the fate of many long-running horror series. It is your responsibility as the main writer of this series that your creation does not become a joke later down the road. Even if it does, in thirty years, expect to find a credit on your IMDb page for a remake you had no involvement with. Best regards, Stefan.

I joined the line immediately. Turns out, I’m just like Dr. Lewis in Don McKellar’s remake of the 2003 Quebec film, La Grande Séduction. I’ve got a soft spot for bowlers and batsmen. And now I’m thinking it’s actually possible you planted these people in line. They seemed like real festival-goers – grasping their orange tickets, impatiently checking their watches and buzzing with anticipation – but you certainly have a wonderful handle on creating believable fictions. Your version of the The Grand Seduction takes place in the made-up harbour of Tickle Head, Newfoundland. With the town’s aging population almost entirely destitute, Murray French (Brendan Gleeson) and his friend, Simon (Gordon Pinsent), hatch a plot to have a waste processing plant built in town. The deal requires Tickle Head to have a full-time doctor in residence. When Dr. Paul Lewis (Taylor Kitsch) arrives for a month-long trial posting, Murray and Simon drag the entire community into an elaborate ruse to convince him to stay, resulting in hilarious crash courses in cricket, Indian cuisine and jazz-fusion. But of course, I was the one who ended up being seduced. Mostly by stunning New Bonaventure, located in Newfoundland’s Trinity Bay area. The sets, such as the local bar/restaurant Joe’s Place, built from scratch for the film, paint a picture of a tiny harbour in a state of significant disrepair and neglect, coupled neatly with the lethargy and despair of its residents. Yet the contrast between the shabbiness of the town and its breathtaking surroundings actually serves to establish the resilience of those who live there. The houses may be shabby and in need of the odd coat of paint, but they are also warm with the care and pride their inhabitants take in filling them with the things, that root you to the place you call your own and reassure you that you are home. But enough about your stellar production design (again, well done). We need to talk about the cricket. That’s what I signed up for. As the daughter of a cricket enthusiast, watching Murray and co. attempt to stage a match for Dr. Lewis is something I won’t soon forget. I can fully relate to the sheer confusion that comes from trying to figure cricket out. To their credit, the boys nearly had it. Somewhat. Okay, not at all, really. What Tickle Cove needed more than a doctor was a cricket coach. Someone to explain the bunsen, mollygrubber, and silly-nanny, and to teach them that an oar is a poor substitute for a cricket bat.  I mean come on, it felt like they were being taught by a production designer.

Your particular job is to use popular films and TV shows, hoping the sight of our heroes lathered in Axe body wash or defending a 7-Eleven will translate into sales. But back in the late 1980s, a Stetson-wearing hustler named Ron Woodroof had a lot more at stake creating new revenue models. In fact, his life depended on it. He sure could have used your help, because he wasn’t exactly the ideal candidate to sell new HIV treatments during the AIDS epidemic. Yet that central tension is exactly what makes Dallas Buyers Club so incredibly moving and entertaining. It starts with a very gaunt looking Matthew McConaughey who does a brilliant job portraying Ron as a cowboy. A straight-up rodeo-loving, womanizing, hard-drinking, queer-hating Texan cowboy. And if that was your brand in 1987, contracting AIDS simply didn’t compute. Even as an audience member, who sees Ron for the first time as he’s having sex with two women in a bullpen, the fact he must at least be bisexual couldn’t help but cross my mind. It’s just the way AIDS was advertised for so long. So it’s no surprise that in a homophobic South, Ron loses all his friends and business relationships once news gets out about his illness. From that point, he’s in a damage control of Exxon proportions. The doctors only give him 30 days to live, so Ron focuses all his attention on treatments, and finds out that a local hospital is conducting experimental trials for AZT – a drug that seems to have as many side effects as benefits. This is where he meets the transgendered Rayon (Jared Leto), who becomes an unlikely business partner going forward and perfect foil for some of the films best comedic moments. America has come a long way in understanding AIDS and gay culture, but a plot description like this must still have been a tough sell to advertisers. After all, Ron is no superhero. But in the hands of Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallée, Ron’s sympathetic moments are balanced out with enough ugly truths for the character to feel like a real person (which, of course, he’s based on). There’s no heavenly glow around the performance, and his flaws haven’t been completely washed out to better appeal to the masses.  It’s an atypical Hollywood gamble that pays off brilliantly.  Maybe a little too brilliantly, since I was so absorbed in the story, I never even noticed what you were pushing.

Scenery-chewing bit characters, chronological reshuffling, heavy use of voiceover – they all provide editing challenges. So how do you string it all together? In your case, you artfully steal from one of the most successful heist films in the past decade – Ocean’s 11. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s obvious you dipped into Stephen Mirrione’s toolbox of wipe-cuts, split screens and generally busy editing. This approach keeps things humming along, even if you could have held some shots on the actors a bit longer to mine more emotional tension. I guess you were too busy cutting around all the camera-mugging thespians (Jay Baruchel, Jason Jones, and Terrence Stamp). But as a result, The Art of the Steal too often sacrifices characters for style. It doesn’t help that Sobol’s story is overbloated. Crunch Callaghan (Kurt Russel) was betrayed by his brother Nicky (Matt Dillon) on an art robbery seven years ago. Since getting out of prison, Crunch has been living out his misspent existence doing motorcycle stunts in Quebec City. Inevitably, through Nicky’s ongoing double-crossing, Crunch gets back into the game, and the old team gets reassembled (including an out-of-place Kenneth Welsh as a genial Irishman named Paddy) for one last daring heist. Sounds straightforward enough, but as the double- and even triple- crossing mount up towards the third act, you wish Sobol had gone for simplicity over cleverness. Granted, the main problem lies in the screenplay. There isn’t much an editor can do vis-à-vis character development when the first act is dominated by voiceover telling us how everyone met. I’m sure you could have put together a great moment when Crunch catches Baruchel’s Francie stealing his hubcaps only to give him a shot working as his apprentice. Instead, we have Kurt Russel telling us about it, while you cut crisply around shots of him donning his wheelman gear. I felt cheated – you probably did too. Maybe it was a budgeting issue. I definitely felt the limited scope and scale with so few establishing shots of the various settings. The story jumps around from Warsaw to Quebec, Detroit to Niagara Falls. Aside from the warm yellowish hues of Warsaw, it’s hard to tell the cool-blue locations apart. It was obvious, at least, that you didn’t want to waste the audience’s time.

Except that your film isn’t really about The Beatles, it’s about a more peripheral figure in their history – not fifth Beatle status, maybe fifteenth or so – Freda Kelly, Beatles fan club president and secretary to Brian Epstein.  There are photos of Freda to be sure – family photos of a girl who lost her mother at a young age, the teen who went to work in a typing pool but snuck out at lunch to the Cavern Club, the girl sorting through sacks of fan mail, and standing on the edges of Beatles’ events – all with the same cheeky smile intact.  It’s easy to put these in between the more familiar images and give us a chronology of the band’s rise and fall, though those without a good knowledge of Beatles’ history (should they accidentally stumble into this movie) might be a bit confused. I know you divided the film into different years of the sixties, but Freda, a good storyteller, does jump around a bit in her telling, and it would be wrong of the film not to follow her. Fortunately you have the Beatles’ music itself to move the film along at a good clip.  The difficulty in thinking of this film as a story of The Beatles is that Freda wasn’t there for the moments we know best – the tours or the recording sessions or the arguments – what’s more, decades later she’s still refusing to gossip or even to choose a favourite Beatle.  Instead Freda’s story becomes one of loyalty, and of the nature of fandom.  She considers herself a fan first and foremost, and this has made her sympathetic to the fan club members she dealt with – answering their letters and trying to honour their requests, be it for autographs or hair, even bringing Ringo’s mother a pillowcase for him to sleep on and then send back to a lucky fan.  Hearing about how she replied to these letters, and enlisted The Beatles’ parents to help out, creates a picture of a time very different from now with our carefully packaged celebrities.  Freda herself comes through as a dedicated and honest person, qualities that survived the tumultuous times she was in and difficulties in her own life.  She remains steadfast in her refusal to cash in or tell-all, valuing privacy – her own and the band’s – above all else. It must have hurt, as filmmaker, to find out that she gave away all but four boxes of her memorabilia and photos.  But Freda doesn’t seem fussed about the small fortune she likely lost out on – everything went to fans she knew would appreciate them.  Good Ol’ Freda must have been long editing process for you, Helen, having to look for the people on the edges of the photographs and wonder who they were and what their stories were, but it certainly was a worthwhile one.

Is that your go-to? I noticed the Brazzers.com logo got some awkward laughs of recognition from my audience, but more than once Don Jon’s titular hero is seen lustfully punching “porn hub” into the keyboard before indulging in his thrice-daily (minimum) habit. This had to be your recommendation. There’s no way that a sweet-natured, Hollywood heartthrob like Joseph-Gordon Levitt should be familiar with such a depraved portal. I mean, sure, he wrote, directed, and stars in the film, but clearly he needed an expert like you to understand a subject as marginal as pornography. Which means you obviously provided all the other porn-related insights as well, even if they were central to the making of this refreshingly funny and unflinching first feature. Or maybe – just maybe – there’s a part of Joseph-Gordon Levitt that wants the option to point his sticky finger at someone else if he’s ever grilled about his inspirations. That’s only natural. Even amongst men, it’s pretty rare to discuss the dirty deed of masturbating to pornography. And when it comes to sharing that information with a romantic partner, forget it. Most women are bound to react like Scarlett Johansson’s character, Barbara, when she finds out that her new boyfriend Jon prefers the pleasure of pixels over the pressure of real intimacy. I can understand her reaction, but on the other hand (you know which one), I also really appreciated that this movie “went there”, without treating the subject with a cold, sedated—yet strangely judgmental— approach like Steve McQueen’s Shame.  To achieve this accessible and comedic tone, and no doubt distance himself from the character, Gordon-Levitt paints his protagonist in fairly broad (but aggressive) strokes. Jon’s a womanizing, church-going, road-raging, gym rat who both looks and sounds like a character from Jersey Shore.  His family dinners are loud and raucous, his evenings are spent picking-up “dimes” (women he considers a 10), and even after a night of sex, he can’t help but sneak out of bed, boot up his Mac and crank one off.  But it’s the details of the ritual that are so amusing – how the sound of his computer turning on turns him on, the careful time spent browsing before committing to a video, and the unfortunate moments when a climax is ruined by the camera suddenly panning over a man. Only a true pornography enthusiast and professional consultant could be familiar with such vivid details. Right?  Frankly, I would have to be a sick man to say any of these (albeit exaggerated) obsessions resonated with me. So I won’t. My wife reads these reviews from time to time. But as far as movies for adults go – not “adult movies” – I can say pretty openly that I enjoyed this film. It’s light without being fluff, and even has a few late but welcomed character surprises.

When Aila’s father, Jacob (Glen Gould) is taken to the school to be beaten and tortured by Popper, Aila and her friends plan to break into the building, rescue Jacob, and take back a large sum of stolen money. The ensuing fallout sends the film hurtling towards a frantic, devastating climax from which it took me a good few hours to recover. After my lungs had descended safely from my throat, I could appreciate the balance you struck between the film’s various generic and stylistic conventions. My companion was a little put off by the more ‘over the top’ aspects, like the zombies and, in his words, “absurdly villainous” Popper. But the over-the-top-ness never pulled me away from the characters’ very real trauma and tragedy. You use an animated sequence to form a dystopic retelling of an Indian myth, and zombies to represent the collective mental and emotional state of a community and culture brought to its knees by the residential school system. Through it all, the pain and rage of the characters remains firmly rooted in the real.  You put a great deal of heart and sensitivity into telling of Aila’s story. The way she struggles to understand her own existence within the greater narrative of her people draws from what little traditional knowledge her family and elders have managed to pass down. So she improvises, filling in the blanks with her own interpretations of her dead mother’s teachings and stories through her art. Perhaps the same can be said about the film’s more eclectic elements. With so much going on in 90 minutes, I anticipated the film would, at some point, lose its way. I assumed the stylistic and generic schizophrenia would cause the story to catapult away from its core. But it didn’t. It strode boldly from quiet to calamitous, from sobering to searing, with a confidence I sometimes wish I’d see in the work of more seasoned filmmakers. But that’s the advantage of being a first-time filmmaker. Aside from documentaries on the residential school system and its survivors, I can only think of a few fictional narrative films on the subject. There’s also no real canon of First Nations Cinema. So you had the luxury of a more or less blank slate, both in terms of crafting the story and designing the way in which it would be told. Why not fill it in with zombies, ghosts, and mythical beasts?  Best, Nat Status: Air Mail (4/5)"},{"title":"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2","url":"/2013/10/01/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-2","date":"2013-10-01 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Erica Rivenoja, Writer, When I sit down to write a review for Dear Cast and Crew, I often spend a good amount of time deciding whom to address. It’s important, both creatively and conceptually, that I chose someone whose role can crystallize the various thoughts I have about whatever I’m reviewing. It can take a lot of effort, and I like to avoid defaulting to the director or writer because, really, that’s too obvious. But for Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2, I figured, what the hell, why choose something original when taking the easiest path will do? I’m going to put as much effort into this as you put into the film. Sorry to sound so cynical, but that’s how Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 left me feeling. Opening with a five minute rehash of the first film wasn’t the most promising start. Sure, these recaps sort of made sense in the pre-home theatre days, when an audience may have missed the original and had no way to catch up, but today it feels like the laziest way to set up a back story: without trying to fit it organically into the narrative (I get that it echoes the construction of the first film, but it was lazy there, too). And then I realized the real reason for this construction: you actually wanted to undo the ending of the first film. Remember when that machine blew up that caused all the food-related meteorological mayhem? Yeah, about that; it didn’t actually blow up. You (and the other… let me check IMDb… SIX writers) took a trope that would embarrass the shlockiest serial adventure writer from the 1930s and hung your entire premise on it. Okay, fine. At least the premise you built around it held some promise. Running on its own, the device creates food-based life forms, and the now-deserted island town has become a unique habitat. Chester V, a (way-too) Steve Jobs-like CEO swoops down to clear out the residents and cleaned up the town. At the same time, he hires hero Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) as an inventor. Of course, said CEO has his own plans, and after a few of his own teams go missing, he (of course) calls on Lockwood to help him locate the device. And, of course, Lockwood brings all his pals from the first movie with him. Unfortunately, what should be a fun time watching our characters discover new and amusing creatures (the shrimpanzees being the high point) instead devolves into a smorgasbord of references to better films. Set design and even whole scenes are lifted judiciously from Jurassic Park, Avatar, and others. This might work for younger kids who don’t have the frame of reference, but it just made me wish I was watching those more inventive films instead.  Not helping matters is that Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 follows the current animated trend to make everything funny, all the time. For that, I blame co-directors Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn. But the fact the film only ever goes for the most obvious joke, I blame you and your co-writers. It made me feel bad for the cast, too. They certainly give it their all. Hader and Anna Faris have good chemistry, and James Caan gives real warmth to what on paper (your paper) would be a stock character. Will Forte, as Chester V, and Kristin Schaal, as Barb the baboon, are also nice additions to the cast. And since they’re really the only two new characters in the entire film, I’ll end my discussion of the cast here. Actually, I just realized this review is well over our minimum word count. I know you won’t begrudge me for simply fulfilling my obligations here, so I’ll take my cue from Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2, and save my creativity for something else.

Not the opening credits (of which there aren’t really any), but the inter-titles you designed for Rush as the story skips through time. The font was always italicized (to look fast), with the axis slanted (to look faster), and the information was not neatly packaged in the corner of the screen.  The city names, dates and specific races were plastered all over, like an excited flyer from the 1970s selling us on this strange speedy sport. And as my eyes raced around, I felt like a Formula One driver myself. Only my version of chasing titles wasn’t nearly so dangerous. Actually, I could have used your help right from the start. The story opens with a voiceover by Niki Lauda (played by Daniel Brühl), delivered in a staccato, no-nonsense German accent. He tells us that he’s best remembered for two things; his rivalry with fellow Formula One driver James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), and what happened on “one August, 1976, when I was chasing him like an ass-hole”.  Note how he words the date. Does he mean “August 1st” or “one August day in 1976”? I couldn’t tell. Which actually confused the climax for me, even if the event in question is unmistakable by the time the final credits roll. And I think because I was caught up in the story calendar, it took me that long to really appreciate the film. Though it’s based on a true story, Rush is not really about the specific events and dates you give us. It’s not even about racing cars. This is a story with two rival protagonists and their symbolic relationship in a de facto death club. Appreciating the risks they were willing to take to win the title of world champion is important, but it’s not necessarily the point. Instead, it’s more fun to just watch their opposing philosophies crash headfirst in a world with seemingly arbitrary rules and perilous rewards. Sure, director Ron Howard can’t help but revel in the labels of the two men – Hunt being the British playboy and carefree poster child of 70s hedonism, while Lauda is the stereotypically calculating, cold and serious Austrian. But leveraging those traits for tragedy instead of comedy helps the film avoid feeling like a Hollywood cliché. In fact, the down and dirty approach of the visuals is a refreshing departure for the director and helps us focus on the characters. Ultimately, that’s the part of the story that makes the film exciting. Not the shaky race cinematography, not the aggressive sound design, and certainly not your zooming inter-titles.

As two childhood best friends whose relationship is strained by drug addiction, Michael and Chris are the heart and soul of your story.  Actors Peter Cilella and Vinny Curran share remarkable chemistry with each other, and perfectly compliment your knack for writing extremely realistic, natural sounding dialogue. These two guys feel completely genuine.  Everything about their relationship works, from the petty digs to the earnest moments in which they reminisce about better times.    And because we’re so invested in their lives, the film’s transition into the overtly supernatural, marked by the boys’ dawning realization that they’ve attracted the attention of an entity hopelessly beyond  their comprehension, is all the more effective.  Let me tell you something: I think of myself as being fairly jaded, but the fact that you can take something as mundane as two guys watching a videotaped conversation and make it absolutely bone-chilling speaks volumes as to your talent as a writer.  Well done, sir, well done. But it’s not just two protagonists you’ve so cleverly crafted. The supporting characters are just as strong, from the twitchy drug addicts who constantly seem seconds away from committing a terrible act of violence, to the reclusive French student who lends possible insight into the nature of the friends’ predicament, to the stoic owner of the house Cilella has been unknowingly squatting in. They all captivate.  I’ll be perfectly honest: the first time watching I wasn’t sure how necessary these people were to the forward movement of the plot; it’s impressive that, instead of simply being filler, you’re able to make them essential to the resolution of the story. I really admire your determination to avoid giving the audience an easy ending—or, for that matter, conveniently explaining what the entire movie was about. It may be polarizing for many people, to be sure, but it works.  Personally, the ending is a wee bit too abrupt for my liking, but days later I still couldn’t stop thinking about it.  And when so many genre pictures these days are of the in-one-ear-out-the-other variety, that’s about the highest compliment I can give.   Sincerely, Kelan Young Status: Air Mail (4/5)"},{"title":"Gravity","url":"/2013/10/04/gravity","date":"2013-10-04 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Andrew Thomas, Astronaut Advisor Why would someone like you dedicate his life to floating in space? It goes against one of the only immutable laws of nature we know—what goes up must come down. To fight gravity is to defy God Himself. Of course, that’s why it’s so appealing, right? Man’s incompatibility with outer space is the premise that makes Alfonso Cuarón’s new film so incredibly compelling, but it’s not what makes it a masterpiece. Like the scientific breakthroughs of aeronautics, Gravity is innovative, important, and incredible to behold. It’s everything cinema should be. Much will be made of the film’s technical achievements, and rightfully so. Gravity is immersive in ways that few Hollywood films even attempt. It’s most obvious in the long takes and smooth, floating photography, but it’s there too, in the minimal sound design and the surprisingly purposeful use of 3D. All these decisions had me, as an audience member, marveling at the film’s construction. But the film also achieved the difficult dramatic effect of linking my emotional experience of the film to the fictional experiences of veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). Watching their mission fall apart, Andrew, you must have had some sweaty flashbacks of your 177 days in orbit. I wouldn’t be surprised if NASA started screening this film as part of its psychological training. But it’s not just the cold, unforgiving nature of space that had me gripping my seat. Bullock’s performance accounts for much of the life-and-death tension. Her desperate reaching, terrified expressions, and frantic breathing had a decisively physical effect on my own wellbeing. Meanwhile, Clooney seems to be channeling some measure of Cmdr. Chris Hatfield’s charm (but at least we know that’s an authentic demeanor among some of your colleagues).  The bigger question I’m sure you’ll be asked is “was the film in any way realistic?” Except I’m not really interested in the answer. For me, the film addressed some larger truths about our place in the universe and our growing fears about our alienation in the face of new technologies. Plus, beyond exploring the simple mechanics of surviving in space, there’s an interesting metaphor about birth that I may save for another letter (in case you thought that fetus-looking shot was simply a visual reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey).  But, for space nuts like you, as well as any audiences looking for a genuine thrill, Gravity should defy expectations.

Leonardo DiCaprio, one of the film’s producers and a renowned environmental activist, must have lured you into this slipshot production.  Shame on him. On the bright side, your part was one of the best performances! When you slyly creep up on that chicken carcass floating in the water and then… crunch! Well done, Crocodile.  If only the film’s director, or its screenplay writers, or anyone, really, could have equally sank their teeth into the material.  Since I’m sure no one bothered to tell you, here’s what your co-stars were up to in the film. Richie Furst (Justin Timberlake) is a poor Princeton student who struggles to make tuition.  He’s got nobody to fall back on since his father (John Heard) is a pitiful gambling addict.  But the apple never falls far from the tree, and Furst tries to make ends meet by steering Princeton students to online gambling sites, exacting commission, and by gambling himself.  He loses all of his money one night, but suspects he was cheated.  So he decides to go find the head of the gambling site he played on, poker magnate Ivan Block (Ben Affleck), in tropical Costa Rica, to be compensated.  That’s where you come in, Crocodile.  Once the story moves to Costa Rica – which, as you know, was actually shot in Puerto Rico – Furst locates Block, makes an impression, and lands a job with the online gambling organization that cheated him. Furst then falls for Block’s babe associate/girlfiend, Gemma Arterton, and they have a terribly unconvincing romance.  The thing is, Crocodile, the film was so incredibly vacuous that nothing in it ‘worked.’ Not even a carnal scene between two heartthrobs like Arterton and Timberlake; not even a crocodile scene with you. Nothing but crocodile tears all around. Don’t feel bad, Croc, Lawrence Olivier wouldn’t have made a difference.  Too many basic ingredients were missing in this wannabe suspense:  a solid script, or a convincing villain, or, you know, suspense. The film’s director could have, at least, included you in those party scenes filled with boobage and booty.  You could have run out of the water in a Jaws-busts-the-bikini-party sort of way, and wreaked havoc. Instead, you were given a role not fit for a reptile, unsuccessful in its attempt to inspire terror and suspense.  Instead, we got Affleck playing a sore excuse for a villain. In one scene, his character pours a bucket of chicken fat on some Mafiosi’s head, and then pushes him into the water where you’re supposed to devour him. Except instead, you…  well, I won’t ruin it for those who, despite my warning against it, want to see the film.  Suffice it to say that it was awkward, unconvincing and gross – because of the chicken fat, not you!  Runner Runner, as a whole, is a mess. It’s too bad, because the online gambling thriller angle could have worked.  After all, San José, Costa Rica, is a real and renowned online gambler’s paradise. Surely a little sociological research could have uncovered something interesting.  And, as your cameo appearance portrayed, Crocodile, Costa Rica’s a wildlife sanctuary.  Those two aspects of the story could have substantiated the film.  Alas, they didn’t.  But if you think you were represented poorly, you should hear Timberlake and Affleck’s Spanish.  Lo siento, Katherine Status: Return to Sender (1.5/5)"},{"title":"Short Term 12","url":"/2013/10/08/short-term-12","date":"2013-10-08 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Destin Cretton, Writer and Director, I always aspired to be a child prodigy. It seemed that if something was worth doing, it was worth doing at a preternaturally young age. Throughout my early years I tried hard to live up to these pretentions: in grade school, I attempted to write several novels (they all involved genetically-engineered dinosaurs and hubristic theme-park owners unable to contain them); at seventeen, I sent spec screenplays to Hollywood studios (my great accomplishment: receiving a rejection letter on official 20th Century Fox letterhead, signed by Batman Forever writer Akiva Goldsman). My ambitions, however, were grander than my talents. Or perhaps grander than my commitment to seeing them through. And your new film, Short Term 12, proves that you’re a bit more committed to your ambitions than I was. Short Term 12 reeks of youth. It’s a movie about young people, starring young people, made by young people. And while, in most cases, such abundance of youthful talent and enthusiasm is anathema to this aging hipster’s increasingly world-weary aesthetic, I found myself deeply moved by it. Moved, I suppose, the way a young person might be moved by a piece of art; willingly, unconditionally.    Sure, at times it feels a little too perfect. One can see where the edges of the plot are worn down from too much polish. Too perfect, perhaps, but never too precious. And never precocious. Which is a profound accomplishment for a movie about at-risk teenagers and the noble twenty-somethings who look after them. Much of this emotional credibility comes from the performances. Brie Larson (24), who plays the head counsellor at the foster care facility from which the movie takes its title, stalks through her scenes with a matronly weight on her shoulders. She’s slow, dignified, and simultaneously twitchy, self-conscious; a duality that lays bare everything you need to know about her character before it’s revealed through the machinations of the narrative. Kaitlyn Dever (16), who plays one of the facility’s troubled teenage residents, performs with all the annoying tics and sneers of a teenage girl without ever making her character annoying—the sort of trick only a veteran actress can pull off (she’s been performing in front of cameras since the age of nine). Keith Stanfield (22), as another resident, rhymes with more flow than Kanye (36) and more depth of feeling than Drake (26). But here’s the thing, Destin: you’re not as young as I thought. Of the empirical data I’d absorbed about Short Term 12 before walking into the theater – most of it by absorbed by accident from the sidebar marginalia of online articles and overheard in podcasted ramblings during my bike ride to work – the number 22 for some reason stuck in my head. Through some erroneous subconscious association, I assumed it was your age. But it’s not (twenty-two is the running time, in minutes, of the short film Short Term 12 was based on). You are, in fact, thirty-four years-old. The same age as I am. So, what does that say about my sense of your film being fuelled by crude, unfiltered, uncynical youth-energy? I suppose it means that the audaciousness associated with younger artists isn’t exclusive to them; that maybe even dudes like us –  who, burdened by the encumbrances of age (accumulated knowledge of how the world really works and an intense envy of those ignorant of it) – are still capable of possessing (and expressing) a worldview that is real and relevant and sometimes dark but still, somehow, idealistic. I suppose it means that you don’t have to be young to make prodigious art.

Without even knowing who you were, I could smell the nepotism the second you appeared onscreen in Machete Kills. Put bluntly, it was your lack of sex appeal. You play nurses dressed like…well, actual nurses (the kinds that help people, but with machine guns). Unfortunately there’s just no place for that kind of conservative reality in this exploitation universe. But this kind of mistake is typical when family members are cast. Your beloved uncle has castrated his earlier vision of the Mexican vigilante with boring violence, recycled gags, and silhouetted sex scenes. Machete has become a bloody Austin Powers ripoff. Unacceptable. The worst offense of all, of course, is the film’s lack of nudity. Female nudity, particularly. There’s none. I know that we’re not supposed to come right out and say it (as esteemed film critics), but it’s true. The original Machete was a testosterone paradise of bullets, blood and boobs. And, yes, all three are equally crucial to the success of the genre. Comedies need to create laughs. Dramas need to create empathy. Horror movies need to inspire fear and science fiction needs to inspire awe. So when it comes to BIG DUMB B-movies, one needs to create a world where boyish fantasies come true. Not just with a hero-saves-the-day story, but the naughty stuff. The look-over-your-shoulder-in-case-your-parents-suddenly-walk-in experience. I can’t tell you how many movies me and other young men have sat through on the mere titillating prospect. Unfortunately, Chekov’s proverbial machine gun bra never does come off. So why am I directing this complaint at you? Because you’re close to the film’s director/writer/producer/editor/cinematographer/composer Robert Rodriguez. As his nieces, you’re probably too close – and that’s the problem. He needs to hack away the guilty conscience that obviously interfered with the making of this film. You were both in the original film (fully clothed, of course), and that film really hit the right balance of parody and excitement. But something has changed. The fun is gone and Machete Kills is simply going through the motions. For example, Alexa Vega is all grown-up and sexed-up in the film after starring in four Spy Kids movies with Rodriguez. However, as confidently as she fills out the full metal bra and assless chaps, there’s a clear guilt in his camera’s male gaze that refuses to linger. I don’t think she even gets a line of dialogue. His regret of giving her the Spring Breakers/Miley Cyrus treatment is obvious. He’s starting to feel like a dirty old man, and we can tell. Well, tell him to move over. Because some of us have clearly not grown up and want our B-movies back.

I’m sure you didn’t. You’re an Oscar-winning screenwriter, for God sakes. But alas, you’ve gone and done just that. You’ve created a “safe” version  of this “dangerous” story for the people who want to be spoon fed their classics. Too safe in fact. And now, thousands of high school students are going to have to endure your version during English Lit when they could be creating Vines with more inspiration than your script. The way you managed to dumb down the original material is genius, I’ll give you that. Iambic pentameter, de damned! You made the words sound just enough like Shakespeare that most people under the age of twenty-five might believe it actually is Shakespeare. In fact, the chuckles in my audience seemed to be directed at the jokes, and not your adaptation.  Some people clearly didn’t know the difference. Bravo! You manage to hit all the major dramatic points, thankfully. But, let’s face it, how could you not – the Shakespearian societies would have your head on a stake… if they don’t already. You have the setup of the family feud between the Montagues and the Capulets; the beautiful young lovers who meet and mingle with raging hands and hormones; the scrappy fights between Tybalt, Mercutio, Romeo and Paris; the Nurse and the Friar and their scheming yet loving ways; the inevitable end with grave consequences of sucking back deadly poison and stabbing yourself in the chest. They’re all in there. With new twists, of course (don’t worry, I won’t give away the ending). A new scene or line sprinkled here and there to keep things “fresh”. Romeo’s occupation as a bare-chested artist, for example. Your way of making the original “more accessible” for common folk. Jazzing it up for the new generation. I’m with you. Now, I’m not sure if your script called for the dialogue to be delivered with such urgency, but Hailee Steinfeld and Douglas Booth, as Juliet and Romeo, were often stumbling to get their words out. Early Modern English or Early Modern English with a Fellowes’ twist, it mattered not. For instance, during the famous balcony scene, I couldn’t help but feel you were trying hard to channel a little Sorkin in there, trying to capture the essence of fast paced witty teen dialogue. Or, maybe that was all you? I know, I know, Romeo’s hanging out on her balcony and he shouldn’t be there. But you lost the joy of that scene for me, and how their young lust blossoms. If anything, you could have played with the language a little more in those moments. And, speaking of playing, what happened to the rest of the sexy-time scene? I hear it got left on the cutting room floor because of Hailee Steinfeld’s age. Too bad. This version comes off a wee bit chaste for modern times. You should see what the teens are watching on the Interwebs these days. So, Julian, your version of “never was a story of more woe” left me lacking. It’s watered-down entertainment distilled from rich source material. It felt flat and outdated for the audience you were aiming for. Even the deaths were kind of boring. The only time your writing came alive was through Paul Giamatti as the Friar, especially when he was giving Romeo a hard time about staying out all night. That was clever.   Maybe that’s where you deserve some credit, as a producer. If you had a hand in getting Paul Giamatti and Lesley Manville on board, thank you. They saved me from being completely bored out of my mind. Walking out of the theatre, I wanted to go immediately home and re-watch the 1996 Luhrmann version. I wanted to restore the sense of being so in love that you feel like you’re going to die when it’s taken away. That’s what young love feels like, Julian. Do you remember that far back? I’m not so sure.

Perez, Clearance Counsel, Those are some mighty big balls you’ve got.  Like, cartoonishly big. You’re the one who ultimately told writer/director Randy Moore, sure, go ahead; risk a lawsuit from Disney – one of the most fiercely protected corporate identities in American history.  But you didn’t stop there. The official website for Escape From Tomorrow is throwing up a big middle finger at the notoriously litigious enterprise, featuring a big countdown clock titled “number of hours since release that we haven’t been sued” (4 days, 13 hours, 41 minutes as of this posting). It’s a dangerous game of chicken being played, but also a little transparent. You’re obviously hoping a cease-and-desist order will allow you to market this as “the film Disney doesn’t want you to see!”. Except it’s more likely to be the film Disney doesn’t care if you see, because it’s just not that good. Still, the audacity of secretly filming an entire feature film at both Disneyland and Disney World is no small feat. And for much of what unfolds on screen, I’m not really surprised the crew got away with making this hand-held, black and white film. After all, it’s simply the story of a man, his wife, and their two kids who are spending a day at the most magical place on earth as they endure spinning Tea Cups, long line-ups, and typical group separation anxieties. Shot with a few handheld 5D Mark II cameras, staging these scenes amongst the crowds wouldn’t have phased a soul. It’s probably not even that uncommon for middle-aged men to navigate the whole park chasing young Lolitas who laugh and lick their lollipops in short-shorts as they frolic through the grounds. That’s of course where the father (Roy Abramsohn) starts getting into trouble, before his mind starts to warp with surreal visions while on classic park rides like It’s A Small World (that notably do not contain the most iconic, and lawsuit-worthy, characters). There’s a fine line being walked at times, but it’s strange where you advised your client to take precautions. Epcot Center is frequently named and featured, becoming a center point of the film’s climax, and images of the Disney castle and name of the park are used early on. But as the film dips into a more twisted (and strangely less interesting) tale, the word “Disney” is spoken but bleeped out, Walter Disney is referred to simply as “WD”, and a bottle of lotion is black-bar censored (I’m still trying to figure that one out).  How and why these things all come together, both at a narrative and legal level, feel circumstantial, and don’t evidence a deeper or more meaningful film. This is a novelty product that’s more shameless than anything Disney itself has ever done. Including Planes. How’s that for an indictment?

Though the complexity and stress of the situation for someone like you – responsible for organizing and overseeing the daily commute of cast and crew to and from location – is tenfold. And it all pales in comparison to the maritime detour taken by Richard Phillips, captain of the Alabama Maersk, who, in 2008, found himself the captive of Somali pirates after a failed hijacking attempt. Paul Greengrass’s dramatization of the kidnapping (and ensuing military intervention) is replete with those themes and tropes that now feel essential to the Greengrassian aesthetic: ordinary folks in extraordinary situations (United 93), government agents in screen-filled bunkers communicating through headsets in esoteric military jargon (the latter Bourne films), and American everymen navigating exotic and dangerous foreign cultures (Green Zone). In those films, and particularly in this one, Greengrass labours to balance the tension between the simple requirements of drama – conflict, stakes, change – and the restless verité lens through which he shoots it all. A conflict of moods that is nakedly apparent in the film’s very last scene, when Phillips, clearly in shock, hardly able to speak, is bombarded by questions from an army medic. She’s overwhelming him on purpose, trying to keep him focused, conscious; he’s covered in blood, and she’s not sure how much of it is his. While Hanks, in a pretty affecting fit of Oscar-baiting histrionics, stutters and moans and sobs, the medic, clearly a non-actor, delivers orders and calming platitudes in that automaton drone that most nurses learn to master; sympathetic, but never losing its authority or urgency. Hanks acts. But the woman playing the medic (who is uncredited, though we hear her introduce herself as “O’Brien”) simply is. Neither performance, here, feels false, even though there is an inherent falseness in Hanks’ theatrics (which are amazing to behold), and an inherent falseness in the medic’s lack of pretense (which is just as riveting). It’s in this scene that Greengrass finally finds the note of hysterical realism the first two hours of the film seems to be circling around. He finally gets where he was trying to go. But, as you probably know, getting from point A to point B can be a thankless job. In fact, several members of the Alabama Maersk’s crew have (anonymously) criticized the real-life Richard Phillips for ignoring piracy warnings and plotting a course too close to the Somali Coast. They say that he was too bold. They say he had a death wish—just because he wanted to make his destination within schedule. Thankless, maybe, but essential. Just think of everything that goes into a big Hollywood production like this; the million-dollar production design, the bombastic visual effects, the cacophony of sound—these are the common elements of cinema, the necessary pieces, and you see them all onscreen. What you don’t see is the guy who makes sure the cast and crew make it to set on time, the gas tanks are filled, the drivers have the right maps, that there is enough parking at the location. That’s another (perhaps more tangible) example of how authenticity informs drama: the hard work that occurs behind the scenes, the invisible labour that gives melodrama its substantiality. Ultimately – though it strains a little too hard in the last act to keep the tension high – Captain Phillips manages that balance between authenticity and drama well. It gets to where it needs to go, and does it without meandering too far off course. Which is something, Captain Basso, I’m sure you can appreciate.

We get a scene of him late at night, sitting alone at his desk, throwing back a shot of whiskey, peering with tired and troubled eyes at one of your props: an open book. When he closes the book (having come, we assume, to a difficult compromise), we a cut to a close-up of the cover. The title of the tome he’s been contemplating? Medical Ethics. This says pretty much everything you need to know about this Stallone/Schwarzenegger prison-break shoot-em-up. It’s simple. Simple to the point of being stupid. Case in point: 50 Cent plays a computer hacker. But it’s more than that. The one-liners are sub-puerile, the characters zero-dimensional, and the plot twists (identities revealed, traitors uncovered) feel like surprises the same way buying yourself a Christmas gift feels like a surprise; you may briefly forget that you ordered it, but when it arrives you know exactly what’s in the box. Yes, Alixandra: Escape Plan is a bad movie. But there’s something endearing about its badness. Something refreshing about it, even. A self-awareness, maybe. A quality of nostalgia. An admirable competence in its deficiency. I called it stupid, but that’s not accurate. Any film brave enough to rest the framework of its story (all sorts of mumbo-jumbo about Stallone, an expert jail-breaker, being hired to test the security protocols of a brand-new state-of-the-art prison), and millions of dollars of explosions and helicopter stunts, on a simple prop like your Medical Ethics book is utterly convinced of its virtues. Compare and contrast with the fifth Die Hard film, which came out earlier this year. The faux-Greengrassian shaky-cam madness and hyperactive editing style made it virtually unwatchable. Even Bruce Willis’ natural charm was deadened by how seriously the film took itself. Like all the recent comic book adaptations that eschew the four-color pop-artistry that inspired them in favor of dreary false-profundity, it wanted to be something more than it was.   Escape Plan, though not quite a parody, is a bit more content to sit back and deliver on its easy promises. And, besides that vital book, your props play an important role throughout. Stallone, the master escapist, uses pens and eyeglasses and milk cartons to build all sorts of gadgets and increasingly goofy booby-traps. It seems almost like you guys shot the film chronologically, and, two-thirds of the way through, recognized the absurdity of it all and decided to abandon what little devotion to rationality remained. And so, late in the film, as our heroes are (of course) racing against time, Arnie has one of his classic Arnie moments, which involves nothing more complicated than a look in his eyes and one of your props cradled in his arms. Seeing this scene with an audience fully invested in the nonsense made that five seconds almost worth the price of admission. I guess that’s the trick to enjoying Escape Plan: accept that it isn’t interested in exploring ethics any further than showing it on the cover of a book, and just go along for the ride.

Apparently, real programmers don’t just click a big blinking skull and crossbones to unleash super viruses, or hit the ESC key to avert nuclear disasters (who knew!).  If ever there was a film that needed to get the look and feel of coding right, it would be a feature about the WikiLeaks frenzy that took the world by storm a few years ago. But there’s only so much HTML jargon that an average Joe can bear to watch. Which must be why The Fifth Estate essentially turns free-speech mischief-makers Julian Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Daniel Berg (Daniel Brühl) into the cinematic hacker equivalent of 300’s Spartan soldiers. Yes, this is a stylish Movie with a capital “M”. Serious in tone, slick in execution. Director Bill Condon brings us into the world of secure chat rooms and mirror sites by borrowing tricks from his Chicago screenplay and staging fantasy sequences. He interprets cyberspace as endless rows of cluttered cubicle desks on white sand, lit by floating florescent lights and a starry night sky. It’s as good as anything, I guess. And it sure is better than his other tricks, like reading chat text on the (presumably realistic) screens you designed.  Or, worse, seeing it all feverishly projected onto computer users’ faces. In many ways, this type of hyper-dramatization is everything that’s wrong with “the Hollywood treatment.” The story is exaggerated and repacked to fit the demands of a genre—in this case, a thriller. So Condon can’t seem to help himself from frantically swinging his camera around the room and laying down a throbbing techno soundtrack in an attempt to inspire tension and excitement. It’s sometimes more affecting than effective. Alex Gibney’s documentary on the same subject was also very stylized, and makes a good companion piece to call into contrast the details which are omitted (or, in Wiki-scandal parlance, redacted) from this particular dramatization. Based, in part, on a book by Daniel Berg, his avatar in the film becomes the Nick Carraway to Assange’s Gatsby. This is the story of rebels with a cause—even though the characters can’t quite agree on what that cause is. The film provides glimpses into Assange’s secrets and obsessions, but none of the revelations oversimplify his motivations. Certain backstory elements appear, but thankfully aren’t treated like the blinking computer button that solves everything. Instead, each new piece of information is layered and complex; not unlike the software that allowed whistlerblowers to submit documents to the WikiLeaks website anonymously and untraceably. The story also makes clear that Assange is the true architect of WikiLeaks. According to the opening credit sequence, he is a modern-day Bi Sheng, Johannes Gutenberg, and Alexander Graham Bell. As his small group of hackers eventually form alliances with major news outlets to perform their unprecedented document dump, the film finds ways to make the consequences feel significant and real, if not a bit overblown. But, no matter how overblown it gets, it still beats staring at 1s and 0s. You still use those, right?

Except “ordinary” is a hard word to define, as we see in Louise Archambault’s sophomore feature Gabrielle. For you, it probably means being humble, easy-to-please, and relatable—all despite your superstar status in la belle province. But it’s a little more complicated for intellectually-challenged adults, like the characters in this unassuming, poignant drama. Which is why it’s too bad you stole their thunder. You see, for all the film’s virtues, Archambault makes a critical miscalculation in how she uses you. Initially, you’re introduced as motivation for Gabrielle (Gabrielle Marion-Rivard), Martin (Alexandre Landry), and the other members of the choral group Les Muses de Montreal. With Waiting for Guffman anxiety, the group of developmentally-challenged singers practice your song Ordinaire, alternating lines and humming the chorus together. Their goal is to perform a rendition worthy of your company; to create a collaboration that doesn’t feel like a charity case. It’s an easy metaphor that represents the inherent themes of the whole film. But it doesn’t unfold quite as gracefully as it should. Your eventual participation is never in question. The characters are preparing for a show which you have already agreed to attend, making rehearsals all the more important as the group hopes to avoid any potential embarrassment. But when Martin’s mother removes him from the group in the hopes of ending his burgeoning sexual relationship with Gabrielle, the music takes a backseat. This is actually where the story is at it’s best, spurring frank discussions about contraception, independence, and morality.  The couple finds ways to meet, mainly through the help of Gabrielle’s sister (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin), and the film does a good job of eliciting protective feelings towards them. I found myself scrutinizing every physical encounter and wrestling with my desire to see them get together and do so responsibly. It’s a unique place to mine dramatic tension, and helps the film rise above being another simple, sappy love story. Unfortunately, there comes a point where the relationship is treated like just another hook-up. And I realize this might be the point, but it’s also a melodramatic overstatement (something you’re famous for)—much the same way your introduction is teased with a 20-second over-the-shoulder tracking shot that eventually gives up, pans around, and shows us your face. Then we actually spend some time with you before the big show, which – I don’t think is a spoiler to say – reveals you to be a bit of a spotlight hog. We get a full rendition of your biggest hit – Lindberg – and while I’m sure it’s a treat for “ordinary” Quebecers who love the tune, it overpowers the small and extraordinary truths at the heart of the story. Otherwise, really enjoyed the show.

After all, this would be the next action movie starring Keanu Reeves (he knows kung fu)! The first film directed by Keanu Reeves! And most importantly, at least to the aspiring fighters flipping off your casting couch, the first film starring Tiger Hu Chen – stuntman from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Matrix trilogy. Surely if these new fighters made an impression to Keanu as well, they too could one day see riches, glory and fame, right? Fools. Man of Tai Chi was made specifically to warn them against this dark path.    It’s also meant to entertain (I guess), in that classic kung-fu tournament B-movie kind of way. Which must have been a dream come true for someone like you. It demanded that you bring in top hand-to-hand combat top talent, from Ninjutsu to Pencal Silat to Serbian street fighting, all for your selfish viewing pleasure – only to have their lives and fights repacked and sold to audiences around the world. Just like Keanu’s character in the film, Donaka Mark. You evil bastard. Sorry, I didn’t mean that. I’m just having a hard time separating this film from reality. I mean Tiger Chen plays a character named Tiger Chen who’s recruited by Keanu Reeves to star in his big, secret, unknown project. We’re going to have to borrow Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey lingo going forward. So Evil Keanu finds ways to create an Evil Tiger Chen, who bastardizes and lethalizes the old-man-in-the-park martial art of Tai Chi. This makes for some entertaining montages leading up to the ultimate Battle of the Hands, where a couple of good robots are invented from the power of Tai Chi and Home Hardware to kill the Evil Keanu and Evil Tiger. Nope, sorry. Now I’m really mixed up. Whatever. There are some decent fighting scenes throughout, and a plot that chugs along like it should, plus a couple twists and an inevitable showdown to keep the whole thing satisfying. The only real problem is poor Keanu may have stretched himself a bit far by also acting in the film. Look no further than the “climactic” series of close-and-closer cuts as the camera punches in on his face when he delivers lines like “Let. (cut) The show. (cut) Begin (cut)”.

Most famously, Roy Scheider at the stern of the Orca, scooping blood and guts into the ocean (and, most infamously, Samuel L. Jackson chumming the air with motivational rhetoric). But, unlike Jaws and Deep Blue Sea, the new flick for which you chummed, All is Lost, isn’t a shark flick. The danger, here, is a bit more abstract. At first glance it might seem, with its nautical themes and everyman-against-the-odds plotline, is the Volcano-versus-Dante’s Peak companion piece to the fall’s other seafaring thriller, Captain Phillips. But the current film to which it bears a much more striking resemblance is Gravity. Like Alfonso Cuaron’s outer-space amusement park ride, nature is the antagonist—though in All is Lost it’s not an absence of physical force against which our cast-adrift hero struggles, rather a preponderance of it. And, yes, that physical force takes form, eventually, in a school of circling sharks. Which I suppose we can thank you for inviting to the party with your skillful dissemination of chopped-up fish entrails. It’s a random accident that first puts our nameless hero in peril. A stray cargo container collides with his sloop in the Indian Ocean, spilling running shoes into the sea (chum for sneakerheads) and punching a hole in the hull. It escalates from there, as storms, more storms, and even worse storms beset the aging sailor. He relies on every maritime trick imaginable to keep his yacht afloat, and for a while succeeds—but, as it is in this sort of survival film, he is eventually pushed to the brink, and it’s there that we first meet your friends, those sleek underwater killing machines. I think it’s telling, though, that the menace the sharks present is far less immediate than the misplaced lid of a water jug. This is a movie about details. About knot-tying and droplets of fiberglass resin. About making sure you’re clean-shaven before facing death. The presence of sharks feels like too obvious a hazard; a moment of jeopardy too easily conjured in a film that seems to pride itself in finding jeopardy in unlikely places.  That Robert Redford plays this aging sailor must have been quite the experience. He was out there on the water with you—did he help you chuck some chum? Toss a few handfuls of bloody viscera? He seems like the type. His character, too. The coolness with which he meets that first misfortune seems almost callous; but it’s that same coolness that makes the man-versus-nature conflict seem evenly matched. We never learn anything more about Redford’s character than what is revealed by his actions and demeanor. Much is being made about the lack of dialogue in the movie, and, sure, we only hear Redford speak two or three times, but it’s not a quiet performance. He still has that old-school movie star presence, and knows how to use it sparingly.    This restraint is pretty admirable. Where other films (Gravity among them) misjudge the audience’s affections (and attention-span), this flick’s director, J.C. Chandor, knows that there’s nothing more essential, more primal, than a man’s will to live. The stakes can’t get any higher; no saccharine backstory about dead children is required. Late in the film, after things have gone from bad to worse to hopeless, Redford opens up a decorative wooden case. Inside is an antique sextant. And a greeting card. Clearly the instrument – now vital to his survival – was a gift. Redford hesitates a moment, seems about to open the card and read it, but stops himself, tosses it aside, and gets on with the business of celestial navigation. Whatever maudlin message he might have found inside that envelope stays there. Chandor doesn’t need to bloody the water with sentimentality to make us care. He earns it the old-fashioned way.

What works so well about Safe Haven is, despite being a found-footage picture (told from the point of view of a documentary crew investigating a reclusive Indonesian cult), it never strains credibility, thanks in large part to your clever, well-thought-out screenplay. With multiple character POVs, hidden cameras, security footage, there are never any “drop the camera and RUN, idiot!” moments, which is truly refreshing and helped to keep me fully immersed in the experience. And what an experience it is.  Imbued with a deep sense of uneasiness right from the start, Safe Haven unfolds with the intensity – and weird logic – of a particularly vivid nightmare. And as each fright one-ups the last, it never feels like you’re being careless or throwing in cheap shocks; in its own warped way, it all feels cohesive.  By the time it was over, and I was able to take a deep breath to steady myself, I almost felt relieved that it was over. I watch a lot of horror pictures, but it’s been awhile since a flick had such an effect on me. For an anthology film so full of boisterous energy, it’s not hard to imagine that you might feel a certain kinship with your directors-in-arms. Are you curious to know how they fared?  Well, I couldn’t be happier to tell you that not a single one of them turns in a bad effort.  Sure, some are weaker than the others, like the wraparound segment which does little to expand upon (or explain) the franchise’s bizarre and mythology. Phase I Clinical Trials is little more than a series of jump scares (albeit with a truly nifty POV gimmick).  A Ride in the Park, however, which offers a glimpse into the life of a zombie via helmet-cam, is a wonderfully fresh take on a scenario we’ve seen a hundred times before, complete with a surprising (dare I say heartfelt?) conclusion. After the unrelenting madness of your entry, Slumber Party Alien Abduction feels positively lighthearted—despite, of course, an ending that will upset animal lovers (scratch that: upset anyone who isn’t an unfeeling automaton). It’s rare to see an anthology film so consistent. What makes V/H/S 2 work so well is that you and your cohorts weren’t content to take the safe and conventional route. What makes each of your instalments feel special is an energy and enthusiasm to bend and break the rules of found footage filmmaking. It all results in some genuinely inspired storytelling. Even though The Raid was clear enough proof, Safe Haven further emphasizes your talent. Can’t wait to see more from you in the future. And if you have a chance to come back for (the surely inevitable) V/H/S 3, by all means, please do.

A whole driver dedicated just to transporting costumes? Somehow I don’t think it was due to an abundance of wardrobe choices or inefficient planning. More likely it was a result of cultural customs, and was perhaps even a precaution for personal safety. This, after all, is the first feature film ever made entirely in Saudi Arabia. Ever. And it’s pretty darn good to boot. Wardrobe is part of what makes the film so special. It’s right there in the first shot: a close-up of a young girl’s feet, the frills on her white socks standing in stark contrast to the black robe draped over them. With this, we get a glimpse of the person obscured underneath—or, at least, of their personality. Wadjda’s titular character (Waad Mohammed) fully embraces these narrow limits of personal expression, donning a pair of boyish high-tops with purple laces and rolled up jeans. She’s 11-years-old, a tomboy and a rebel living in an orthodox Muslim society that frowns on women doing pretty much anything independent, including riding a bicycle—which is Wadjda’s dream. Writer and director Haifa Al-Mansour turns this desire into a beautifully simple and ironic plot: Wadjda wants to win a Quran recital competition at school so that she can use the prize money to buy a bike. Only problem is, she’s too optimistic to veil her ambitions from the zealots in her life. And she’s not alone. Colorful hair berets and painted toenails are considered acts of defiance that get the girls at Wadjda’s school in hot water. Barbie dolls are sold in full burqas. And if you look closely in the background of the mall scene, even the exposed legs, arms and neck lines of the models in American clothing posters are censored. Repression is everywhere. Women, we see, are forced to scurry like mice when men pass by in the street, or hide in the schoolyard if they find themselves suddenly in view of men on a neighbouring rooftop. From what I’ve read, this even applied to the director herself, who was not allowed on the streets “directing” actors; she had to work by walkie-talkie because women can’t be seen telling men what to do.  No wonder the costumes had to be separated. The film is endlessly fascinating. A pleasure to watch. The performances are perfectly convincing, but there’s just as much story being told in the surroundings as there is in the plot itself. Your costumes certainly won’t get any notice come Oscar season, but I couldn’t take my eyes off them.

In a movie filled with awkwardness, you’re the only actor who feels well-suited to your role. Your performance falls somewhere in the middle of the scale, between the obviously amateur actors and the hilariously overacting semi-professionals (like the leader of the evil cult hell-bent on resurrecting the Midgard Dragon and bringing about Ragnarkok, who seems to think he’s in the Thunderstorm stage adaptation). You underplay things just enough to come off as an appealing, relatable everyman. I especially related to the way your character constantly looked as if he would rather be somewhere else. I’m not sure if this was a skillful demonstration of Grant Farrel’s desire to escape the improbable situation in which he has become embroiled, or your own desire to escape the improbable situation in which you were embroiled. While watching Thunderstorm, I, too, sometimes wanted to be somewhere else. The film’s initial amateurish charm wears off quickly; the minutes began to feel like hours. But the whole experience was made infinitely more bearable because we were in it together. And I’ll never forget that, man. But I do have to ask: what did you think of your Thunderstorm costume?  I can imagine how perplexed you must have been to find that, despite starring in a motion picture heavily reliant on Norse mythology, you would, in fact, be required to wear a rabbit-eared Iron Man suit in every action sequence. In fact, after your performance, the costume is the second-most brilliant element of the film. I can’t help but give props to how cleverly it manages to steal from two of Marvel’s biggest comic book characters simultaneously. Now that’s some good mockbustering. Sincerely yours, Kelan Young.

Getting daily production reports, overseeing the cash flow, making sure stars come out of their trailers – you’re the person who has to say, “It doesn’t matter how stupid this all seems, you agreed to make this fucking thing, so do it.” And on a movie like The Counselor, you might be the only reason the film ever got finished. But really, who can blame you for buying into a film so packed with potential? First, you have Sir Ridley Scott at the helm. True, he hasn’t directed a proper critical or commercial success in over a decade, but the man is a bona fide talent who can attract the best in the business. For this job, he lined up a parade of A-listers to tackle the material: Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz and some impressive supporting players. But the best part? They’re working from an original screenplay Cormac McCarthy! No chance anything will be lost in translation from his novel for once, right? Start printing the money and Oscar ballots now. Well, hold on a second. Clearly you, Scott and co. didn’t learn anything from Oliver Stone’s eerily similar venture. So once again, a star-studded cast is pitted against the savage drug trade along the U.S.-Mexican border. This time, the story focuses on an unnamed legal Counselor (Fassbender) who wants to finally make the big bucks by bankrolling a risky drug scheme (is this suddenly sounding a little close-to-home?). He’s looped in by Bardem’s thinly painted portrait of a wacky cheetah loving drug-lord and the man’s sexy, nympho, cheetah-spot-tattooed girlfriend (Diaz). The Counselor keeps his own girlfriend (Cruz) blissfully in the dark about his exploits, and politely refuses to heed the warnings of Brad Pitt, playing a Brad Pitt-in-a-cowboy-hat drug-dealer type. It’s a very straight-forward and ultimately, silly affair, capped off by a lot of decapitations and a pointlessly provocative car sex-scene (literally – sex with a car).  Did I miss something? Was there ever supposed to be more to this standard cautionary drug tale than what we got? Maybe not, and maybe it’s that safety in familiarity that got the film financed. But what a waste.

And perhaps even more absurd when one actually sits down to watch Thor: The Dark World. From the very beginning, with its epic, overbearing prologue and charging digital armies, it’s clear that this is not a flick that cares much for bending the rules of blockbuster filmmaking (it seems nervous, in fact, to even brush up against them). Everything unfolds as you might assume. Everything turns out like you might predict. And, at first glance, everything looks like exactly like you’d expect it to look. But there’s something tricky about this second Thor movie (or third, if you count The Avengers). As much as it feels the same as everything else, it’s different. And as much as it looks just like all the other big-budget comic book fantasies, it doesn’t. Somehow, here in dreary November, we’re getting the bombastic, self-aware, fun and colorful blockbuster we were waiting for all summer. How did you do it, Magdalena? There you were, hunched over your drafting table, your sketch pad, your digital tablet, conjuring up the environments and costumes and objects that would occupy the nine realms of Yggdrasil, The World Tree. They are (of course) imperiled by (of course) an ancient evil. And though we’ve seen the golden spires and constructivist walkways of Asgard in the previous Thor movie (no, not that one), we spend a lot more time among them in this sequel, and there’s a thickness and richness to the world that feels tangible—even in sprawling shots clearly built in pixels. That richness is in the details. The winged gondolas that patrol the skies of the city; the knifelike spaceships with whom they dogfight; the porcelain-doll facemasks worn by the dark elf infantrymen—it all seems a step too clever for the average Hollywood popcorn flick. Somehow, despite the tangle of constraints applied to your work by the previous film’s production design and the Walt Simonson comic art that inspired it, you and your fellow conceptual artists managed to create some beautiful landscapes and objets d’art. This level of cleverness and craftsmanship is the sort of thing easily taken for granted. Many critics made it a point to admire the production design in Man of Steel (for lack of anything else to admire, I suppose), but all that insectoid, polished-ebony, bio-industrial type-stuff has been de rigeur since H.R. Giger ripped off his own lithograph to create the creature Alien. And while there’s certainly nothing as innovative happening in Thor: The Dark World, there is something innovative about how well your designs fit the mood – and, I’d guess, the aspirations – of the film. This is a big dumb movie that knows it’s a big dumb movie, and finds space, in the seams between its bigness and dumbness, to sneak in just enough humor and shrewdness that the films seems constantly to be subverting its own mythic inclinations.    Sure, it doesn’t make sense. Yeah, we’ve seen it all before. But nonsense and sameness, when correctly applied, can be virtues for this sort of populist art. It just takes a real artist to bring those concepts to life.   Sincerely,  Jared Young Status: Air Mail (4/5) "},{"title":"12 Years a Slave","url":"/2013/11/13/12-years-a-slave","date":"2013-11-13 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Michael S. Martin, Property Master, They say possession is nine-tenths of the law. In other words, the person with an object is presumed to be rightful owner unless there is clear evidence to the contrary. This must make your job a bit of a nightmare, with so many props flying around set. Still, it would be a pretty rich for an actor to, for example, tear off the tag and walk away wearing a Civil War-era tricorne, pretending it was theirs, right? You would have them fired and give them a real tongue-lashing, no doubt.  But master, I pray that your anger and outbursts aren’t multiplied by the size of the claim. Otherwise, you’ve learned nothing from working on 12 Years a Slave. This trivial comparison of a hat with a human being wouldn’t be ridiculous in the American South of the mid 1800s (not to suggest that stealing and selling people is only a thing of the past). But the slavery debate shaped modern America, and the ultimate refute to those barbaric principles has to be the story of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor). In the extremely able hands of director Steve McQueen, this true story is done justice in ways that are both subtle and severe. Most notably, of course, with the one prop that I’m sure had everyone on set reeling: the whip. Even before Jesus Christ suffered his 39 lashes (considered one short of killing a man), the whip was the ultimate symbol of dominance and punishment. In your film, its use on characters and exposure to the audience is amplified each time it appears. There are other instruments of torture, such as knives, nails and rope, but it’s hard to surpass the theatrics and visceral pain of a lashing. Hardly entertaining, but also hard to shake. And that seems to be the strategy of the film. There’s an uncomfortable air throughout, with shots held a bit longer than we’d like and no foreshowing of relief. The title alone presumes that Northup will eventually be unchained, but unlike the fictional Django, we can also know that his retribution (if any) will never right how badly he was wronged.  And how could it?  Effectively cut together with non-linear editing, the film bounces between scenes of Northup struggling in captivity, and his previous life as a well-educated musician and freeman in Saratoga Springs, New York. The very first scenes show a failed attempt to compose a letter out of a shaved stick and tree sap, and, in what seems another life, tightening the string’s on his violin. The extreme close-ups of these props help build tension even before we completely understand the context. This mirrors the understanding of certain characters, such as the slave traders, slave drivers and slave owners played with increasing cruelty by Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Sarah Paulson and Michael Fassbender. Caught up in the minutia of the law and scripture, they completely fail to see the larger picture. The rest of us, luckily, aren’t so lucky. We see everything.

How you personally earned this title, and what your responsibilities included, are anyone’s guess. Maybe you’re an up-and-coming big shot, or a bona fide number cruncher, or a valued creative partner, or a local string-puller, or someone the director just needed to pacify by slapping a label on you. If it’s the latter (as is often the case), I’m going to imagine you as a troubled Slovakian 15-year-old girl willing to do terrible, terrible things to get that title you desire – be it “associate producer” or simply “girlfriend”.   I really hope I’m wrong. Drawing that parallel between you and Ela (Michaela Bendulova), the main character in Miracle, is far-fetched, right? Surely you would be smarter than selling yourself to human traffickers just so some asshole guy that you like can get himself out of debt. Because – spoiler alert for idiots – that might not go so well. Even if your plan is just to eventually “escape”. Luckily, the way co-writer and director Juraj Lehotsky tells the story, I couldn’t help but feel sympathetic to Ela’s plight. Much like his main character, we as audience members are taken straight to a female re-education centre without any proper explanation. The resulting friction between the girls we meet there reveals more than enough for us to piece together what’s ailing Ela. Her father is not in the picture, her mother (Katarina Feldekova) is tired of dealing with a troubled teen, and there’s a mysterious man whose name is tattooed on her knuckles named Roby (Robert Roth). When Ela finds out she’s pregnant, she runs away to find Roby, but he’s hardly happy to see her, even before she breaks the news. In fact, she seems more like a forced-upon intern pushing for a full-time position than she does an actual girlfriend.  Still, my sympathy rested squarely on Ela’s shoulders, since few other characters even register. And as the story skips quickly between scenes and seasons, brevity may be the film’s greatest virtue. At 78 minutes, Miracle manages to make a strong enough impression to recommend it as at least a cautionary tale to young stubborn women. Which, again, I’m sure you’re nothing like.

They’re too graphic! Too long! Too hetero! The media focus, meanwhile, has shifted to extratextual analysis about the on-set treatment of the actresses by director Abdellatif Kechiche. But you seem to have escaped the controversy. Not surprising, perhaps, since many people outside the industry don’t understand the role of a First A.D. Well, lucky you. Because this film deserves to be seen and discussed, but you should probably also bear some responsibility for the faults. As you know, in filmmaking the director is the top of the creative food chain. He or she, therefore, receives an unbalanced percentage of the praise and criticism when a film is released (and shifting that balance is the very reason we write these open-letters). Blue is the Warmest Colour is receiving uncommon levels on both accounts – winning the prestigious 2013 Palme d’Or at Cannes but now suffering backlash from the story’s original author, the actresses, and even parts of the LGBT community. It would be almost impossible for anyone to see the film right now without having heard something about that. Too bad, because that shouldn’t be leading the discussion (or a review, for that matter); but it is. So let’s clear the air. You’re obviously a trusted collaborator of Kechiche, having been an assistant director for his past three feature films: Games of Love and Chance (2003), The Secret of the Grain (2007) and Black Venus (2010).  You know how he works, and can no doubt anticipate his demands better than anyone. This is important, because you’re the one responsible for the mechanics of the shoot, like overseeing the management of the set-ups, the schedule and the actors. If someone ever needed to pull the director aside because he was being unreasonable, it’s you. However, if you treated your role more like an obedient servant, well then you probably thought anything goes in the service of art. Which it sounds like you did. So the next logical question is, was it worth it? Speaking as a critic, yes, it was (if I was in the labour union, it might be another story). The emotional complexities Adèle Exarchopoulos delivers are quite mesmerizing. If Kechiche obsessed over her performance as much as his camera lingers on her face in close-up, then it’s no wonder the process felt so invasive. The film refuses to let her escape our gaze, from numerous shots of her sleeping, eating, and, of course, having sex. Her expressions and even physical appearance appear to morph before our eyes as her character struggles with her blossoming sexuality. The blue-haired object of Adèle’s affections, played by Léa Seydoux, is equally able in her role as an emerging artist and confident individual. Though her screen time is much more limited, it’s the interplay between the two that wins the day. Yes, Blue is The Warmest Colour is a film all about relationships (both on- and off-set, it seems). But this powerful and effective emphasis can be a problem for both the characters themselves and the filmmaking. The art direction, for example, is often painfully lazy. During a picnic scene, it feels like the whole art department gave up and just went blue – from jean jackets, to shirts, to pants, to backpacks, to hair.  The characters also lose sight of their professional ambitions when their relationship gets in the way. And in that vein, maybe you felt too close to the director to ever say no to his demands. Yet ultimately, for Blue is The Warmest Colour, the ends may have justified the means. But on a thousand other films where actress will be pressured to give more and bear more, that won’t be the case. So please, don’t be afraid to step in next time.

An idea to which you can return, a theme that keeps things cohesive when dramatic events threatens to pull everything apart. Fortunately for you, Living Images  keeps all of its action well-contained. Literally contained. The entirety of this multi-decade story is told from within the confines of a large estate in Tallinn, Estonia. That’s not to say the house itself is the main character. As the narrative traverses the 20th century, it’s used to create different microcosms of Estonian society. The actual main characters are Julius and Helmi, both born in the old house to servants of the Baltic nobles who own it (each both played by a number of actors who depict them at various ages). Their stories weave through history as the house changes owners (and purposes) while Estonia is occupied by Germany, becomes an independent state, is once again occupied (this time by the Russians), and, finally, gains its independence once again, only to fall under the spell of capitalist greed. That greed is the framing device for the film: Estonia’s estates have become valuable in the new economy, and Helmi’s grandson Paul wants to sell the old house to a foreign investor. Also valuable is the old cinema attached to the house, which Julius runs until its final showing (ominously enough, of the apocalyptic blockbuster Terminator 2: Judgement Day); the various owners of the house always find ways to use the small theatre as it suits them. As an editor, this aspect of Living Images must have appealed to you; the history of cinema informs the style of the film itself. Director and co-writer Hardi Volmer shoots each episode of the story in a style representative of the era we find ourselves in: from scratchy silents, to silky black and whites, to garish technicolor. I can only imagine how fun it must have been to splice together and age  the elements to achieve this effect. And it’s a good thing Volmer decided on this technique, because storytelling-wise, Living Images is a bit of mess. Relationships (apart from Julius’ unrequited love for Helmi) are not always clear, and this creates confusion as the years stack up. But maybe this isn’t unintentional; these memories are codified by the popular storytelling medium of the time, and memories don’t always adhere to logic. At times,  Living Images threatens to break under the weight of its story. There’s a lot of Estonian history crammed into these past hundred years—so much that characters are sometimes simply describing what’s happening outside the house. But Julius’ two loves – Helmi and the movies – creates a foundation that is strong enough to support it all, and adds an emotion that, unlike the tumultuous events heap pending around them, snuck up on me in the final moments of the film. To editors, the idea that “the whole is greater than the sum” is more than a cliche. But worse than using a cliché is not using the right words. And here they certainly fit.

Make sure nobody steps out of line. If people disobey orders, they need to be eliminated. Erased from existence. After all, if even a few get out of hand, they could disrupt the whole delicate system. Which is of course why you were brought into the world of The Hunger Games. Well, the post-production visual effects world anyway. But I’m sure the same rules applied. See, in the dystopian vision of the future imagined by Suzanne Collins’ popular book series, tall poppies aren’t just cut down – they’re poisoned, uprooted, and exterminated. Much like extras on a film set, no one is allowed to stand out unless “chosen”. In the first film, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) were drawn from the crowd as sacrificial lambs to represent their district in The Hunger Games. They emerged as co-victors, but are now dragged back into 75th anniversary super-games with previous winners. Or “survivors”, as they more aptly put it. And thus we have Catching Fire, which retraces many familiar plot points from the first film. Too many, in fact. Like the games themselves, the story is treated like another season of a desperate TV show. We get a slightly new setting and a few new secondary characters, but the larger world is explored much less than I had hoped.  The biggest difference is supposed to be that the crowds you had to supervise are getting restless and revolting. Although even that element was shown in the first film (in a small sequence directed by Steven Soderberg). This time, there doesn’t seem much the oppressed can do other than salute in defiance. Yes, this has some pretty grave consequences, but ultimately it feels like you and your collaborating overlords exuded a little too much control over this other storyline. “But wait for the next film!” I can already hear you say. I do look forward to the upcoming installments, but I couldn’t help but feel like this chapter was more about stalling. The focus on Katniss and Peeta’s complicated and deceptive relationship is a worthy emotional anchor, but their agency as characters feels strangely defeated. Too much happens outside of their knowledge and control, which, unfortunately, seems to be the more interesting part. And when the crowd is making more important decisions than your lead characters, you know you have a problem. Here’s hoping the others finally get their moment in the upcoming revolution.

Televisions buzz and chatter with impending news of a DNA test that will determine whether the bodies buried in your gravesite indeed belong to you and your wife. Meanwhile, a documentary is being shot about life during The Golden Era of Ceausescu (as you, yourself, so demurely christened it), requiring hundreds of volunteers to recreate the scenes of state-orchestrated adoration that used to greet you each time your helicopter alit or your motorcade zipped through the streets. Thankfully, this film doesn’t have to strain nearly as hard to make an impression. One of those volunteers is Emelia, a sixty-something woman living modestly in a Bucharest suburb with her vendor husband. When she receives word that her daughter and soon-to-be son-in-law will be visiting from Canada, she seeks a small loan to feed her guests for the week. And it’s at one of these dinners that Emelia is revealed to be the communist hag of the title; pressed by her daughter, she admits that, yes, she preferred your good old days of communism to the shaky free market that threatens each day to swallow her family up. This is a surprisingly common sentiment. Democracy hasn’t been a cakewalk for Romania. And neither has membership in the European Union. Many who lived through your rule are nostalgic for its security and steadiness. Romania always seemed to be the most progressive of Eastern Bloc nations (at least from the West’s point-of-view), but while you were careful to distance yourself from Russia’s geopolitical influence, you were, perhaps, the leader who carried forth Stalin’s style of authoritarian rule most vigorously—what with the crippling economic policies and the brutal suppression of dissenting viewpoints and all. Those aren’t necessarily the things Emilia is pining for in this film. Even she isn’t sure what she misses exactly. For all the talk of the halcyon years of stable housing and employment, Emilia recalls, in a series of flashbacks, being kept away from her family in the days leading up to one of your factory visits. The reason? It’s never clear whether it was your phobia of germs or your sense of paranoia that required her to be quarantined before shaking your hand, which makes the situation even more disturbing. There is no reason. But Emilia nonetheless complies. As played by the renowned Romanian actress Luminita Gheorghiu, Emilia is stout and strong-hearted and also completely adrift in the contemporary world; she frets over the worldwide financial crisis; she goes to get her hair cut and comes back with a bright-red punkish do. This sort of incarnate performance is deserving of no small number of superlatives, though what those superlatives might be, I can’t quite say. All of the adjective and metaphors typically used to describe great acting all seem a little too pompous. And if there’s one thing her performance isn’t, it’s pompous. See, that’s the problem with epithets, Nicolae: they don’t aggrandize a person; they obscure. You may have created around yourself the most impressive cult of personality in Eastern Europe when that part of the world was replete with big personalities, but the names you gave yourself – genius, demiurge, titan, Prince Charming – are heavy with their own meaning, and do nothing, today, to define what kind of man you were. They do, however, shed a bit of light on what kind of leader you were. Director Stere Gulea is a survivor of the lean artistic years under your rule – he made several films in the 70s and 80s, during the Communist studio system – and whether or not he shares Emilia’s conflicted feelings about Romania’s past, this much is for certain: he knows better than to give you credit for her wistfulness. It’s herself that she misses. The innocence of her daughter. The simplicity of youth. But not you. Sure, your specter looms large over this film. But that’s all you are, anymore: a ghost.

By the time we hit great-grandparents, well, it’s hard to separate the rebels from the squares amongst all the period costumes and sets.  So it’s probably tempting to take a shortcut by giving modern audiences something familiar to grasp onto rather than doing a lot of world building. Too bad you gave in to this temptation by leaning on music from bands like TV On The Radio and Bloc Party to make-up for the faults in this mid-1940’s set film.  Sure, if you were working with a director like Baz Luhrman, you could get away with it. But Luhrman is a magpie – he’s constructing his world out of those pieces. The mash-up is the point.  Unfortunately, in Kill Your Darlings, director John Krokidas seems to be asking something different of your soundtrack – he wants the jazz for the period feel, the classical music to show that his characters are intellectual, and the alt-pop to give them a more modern edge.  It ends up being a bad mix, with those contemporary songs belonging on an angsty teen TV show rather than a literary drama. Based on an actual 1944 murder involving friends of the college-age pre-Beat writers, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, Kill Your Darlings is also meant to show the birth of a literary movement that resonated for decades.  Daniel Radcliffe at least does a good job of conveying the evolution of Ginsberg’s sexuality and writing style, things that would set him on the fringes of his society. Unfortunately, the movie doesn’t show us what Ginsberg and his friends were rebelling against. The movie mentions homophobia, anti-Semitism, and the peril of a world at war, but they only give us a sense rather than the crushing weight it must have been.  The movie spends more time on the oppression of poetic rhyme schemes – deadening to be sure (especially to a music enthusiast like you), but not something that really engages the average audience. As music supervisor, there are much better options you could have presented to the director.  Last year’s On the Road had its flaws, but it was able to convey the audacity of jazz.  It wasn’t fun swing, or moody torch songs, but raw-edged bebop.  In that movie, when we saw Kerouac and Ginsberg dancing sweaty in a proto-moshpit, it was easy to understand how this music would concern the authorities and stir up the youth.  Here, the most we see is Radcliffe doing some enthusiastic table drumming.  No wonder you and Krokidas thought you needed to bring in the modern music.  That’s not to say that there aren’t things in the film that work and work well. Radcliffe and Michael C. Hall both do excellent jobs of making us forget that they’re best known for other work, and Ben Foster as Burroughs is a treat.  Dane DeHaan as the murderous Lucien Carr has the charm of a baby DiCaprio, though somewhat hampered by overly arch dialogue.  The story itself is an interesting one, with Hall’s character being both stalker and mentor to Carr, while Carr is manipulative enough that it’s hard to believe his version of events.  If Krokidas had trusted his actors and story more the movie might have had a chance to sing.  Sincerely, Erin Status: Return to Sender (2/5)"},{"title":"Frozen","url":"/2013/11/28/frozen","date":"2013-11-28 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Kristen Anderson-Lopez, Song Lyricist When it comes to power couples on Broadway, you and your husband Robert Lopez are certainly the toast of the town. It makes sense that he, the two-time Tony award-winner for Avenue Q and The Book of Mormon, and you, with celebrated work on Winnie the Pooh and the Finding Nemo musical, would be hired to create the music for a film like Frozen. It also sounds a lot like, well, a Disney fairy tale. Which is only appropriate, I suppose, for an animated film that is a triumphant return-to-form for the storied company. From the first musical notes, which evoke the tribal hymns of The Lion King, Frozen is warmly reminiscent of Disney’s animated classics. Like The Little Mermaid, it’s inspired by a Hans Christian Anderson story. It borrows elements from the Sleeping Beauty storyline. The world-building uses Beauty and the Beast’s approach to anthropomorphism, where magic can make objects talk but not animals – in this case, an aloof and ever optimistic snowman, Olaf (Josh Gadd), who also happens to be the best comic relief since Robin Williams’ Genie in Aladdin. One sequence with a snow monster even feels like it’s embracing stop-motion animation techniques from that beloved black sheep of the Disney family, The Nightmare Before Christmas. Yet even with all these comparisons, Frozen never feels derivative or parodical. Instead – and thanks to your music – it’s exactly what Disney fans have been waiting for. The opening song “Frozen Heart” introduces us to the winter kingdom of Arendelle, with male labourers carving out blocks of ice to the rhythm of their deep baritone chants (inspired, no doubt, by Les Misérables show-opener “Look Down”). You then do a wonderful job of pushing the story along through the time-ellipsing heartbreaker “Do You Want to Build a Snowman?”, which transitions our child characters to their adult selves. The hopeful longing continues in the dueling performance of “For the First Time in Forever”, sung between two perspectives of sisters Anna (Kristen Bell) and Else (Idina Menzel). This is where even more of your eccentricities are allowed to shine through, with lyrics like “I don’t know if I’m elated or gassy, but I’m somewhere in that zone”. You also do something novel for Disney by having the characters speak in the repetitive and emphatic verbiage of teenage girls. Take this in stanza, for example: There’ll be actual real live peopleIt’ll be totally strangeBut wow, am I so ready for this change. The songs just keep getting better, from the quirky sing-a-long “Love is an Open Door” to the slightly absurd but wonderfully dippy “Summer Song”. Sure, the film doesn’t have 90s-era Céline Dion or Elton John-esque power ballad, but that actually feels appropriate for a film that ultimately aims to subvert both story and song conventions whenever possible. You obviously wanted to put some distance between yourself and your predecessors Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. It works, and the film succeeds as a result. So in that spirit, here’s hoping you and your husband can keep working in such “sync-ro-ni-city” and continue to finish each others… sandwiches.  Sincerely, Christopher Status: Priority Post (4.5/5)"},{"title":"Shifting the Blame","url":"/2013/12/04/shifting-the-blame","date":"2013-12-04 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":"2013 European Union Film Festival coverage  Dear Darko Lovrinic, Produktionsleiter, You can recognize a European film by the fact that most everything is made out of people. The heroes, the antagonists, the monsters, innocent bystanders—each one a person. I could not detect any CGI. There were no talking animals or extraterrestrials. And there’s something compelling about that these days. Because of these unusual decisions, Shifting the Blame (Schuld sind immer die Anderen)* feels stripped down, raw, and genuine. But never easy. Though all the parts are played by people, the standard roles themselves were thrown out, and everyone simply is. The story revolves around uncomfortable layers of revealed…people. This is a first film by director Lars-Gunnar Lotz, and all the more impressive for it.  It’s an intimate work: the camera keeps close, the sky hangs heavy and grey, and the whole thing takes place in and around a single geography, Stuttgart. People are trapped and bound, even in the open country. Screenwriter Anna Prassler has wrought a balancing act with the script that I don’t even totally understand. The acting always makes sense and feels honest, even as the actors play to multiple layers of tropes that flirt with becoming clichés.  It almost doesn’t matter what the movie is about. The style of telling and the skill of the script make the people and what they do fascinating. The plot itself revolves around the anger, actions and resulting imprisonment of young Benjamin (played by Edin Hasanovic). He finds himself an unorthodox outpatient-style prison run by a complicated couple—Eva (Julia Brendler, brilliant) and Niklas (Marc Benjamin Puch, very very good). Benjamin’s past is a secret, and like all movie secrets, it is truly terrible. People lie. Others are tormented. And yes, it totally sounds like a made-for-TV movie. If you watch the trailer, you will probably doubt every true thing I have ever written (don’t watch the trailer). But despite, and because of all this, it is indeed an awesome little film. Managing the production of a movie that doesn’t go far into space and has no detectable animatronics or scale models probably makes your job a little easier, too.

Not many, mind you, and for good reason. As your first film makes abundantly clear, there’s very little glory in getting beaten to a pulp to earn a buck. Sure, for the most part you only have to look like you’re taking a bruising (I hope); but Out of the Furnace is made with enough grit that I could almost taste those cut lips and blood-soaked tears. It’s a strong film about characters constantly at the breaking point. Until, of course – SNAP. The fighter you no doubt stood in for was Rodney Baze Jr. (Casey Affleck), a returning Iraq veteran who can’t stomach the idea of working at the town mill like his brother Russell (Christian Bale). So instead, he gets mixed up in the world of underground fighting to try and pay off his debts. Woody Harrelson plays the sadistic ring-leader behind the business, in a role that leaves exactly zero room for empathy or understanding. He’s simply a blunt force of antagonism, no more complicated than a fist to the face. He tends to overshadow the film’s other conflicting elements, such as PTSD and the failing U.S economy of 2008. The latter is most interesting. Much like Killing The Softly, the characters in this film often sit in bars listening to Obama’s first presidential campaign promises, which bounce off the walls with a contemporary echo of disillusionment. There’s very little hope and change to be found in co-writer and director Scott Cooper’s sophomore film. Instead, it’s simply the grind of misfits and ex-cons trying to realign themselves with the new outsourced America.  The war, the prison, and the fights may take the greatest physical toll, but that’s not what seems to have worn them down. In fact, those are the only institutions that seem to make any sense to them. There is, however, some light at the end of the tunnel, in the form of the always lovely Zoe Saldana, playing Bale’s ex- and (he hopes) future-girlfriend. But in a refreshing change of pace for this type of high-strung drama, he doesn’t try to win her over by fighting with her current boyfriend (Forest Whitaker). His strategy is more elegant and endearing, dancing around her and trying to draw her in slowly. Until, of course, things go really wrong in his life and he’s pushed back into survival mode. What the film lacks in originality, it at least balances out with solid performances and a confident script. The final punch that’s thrown into the story is a proper knock-out, but is strangely undermined by a last-second scene, which down-graded the resolution to only a technical knock-out.

I’m more inclined to believe Robert Frost: “Home is where, when you have to go there, they have to let you in.” And that seems to be the guiding principle behind your new film How I Live Now. On the surface, it’s a survival story set during the outbreak of a third World War. But really, that’s just the window dressing for a good old fashion coming-of-age tale. One that centers on a teenage girl finding her place in the world – literally, and figuratively. Though it’s not always successful. Let’s start with the literal part, since that’s obviously your cup of tea. Saoirse Ronan plays Daisy, an American girl who is shipped off to stay with her relatives in the U.K.  She lives in her own head, doing her best to block out the world with headphones clamped to her ears and a constant “piss-off” disposition. Director Kevin Macdonald tries to get us into Daisy’s unruly headspace with rapid-fire overlapping voiceovers and the moody rock of Amanda Fucking Palmer. As Daisy reluctantly makes her way through higher-than-normal airport security, she eventually gets to a serene house in the countryside.  Of course, she can’t see the beauty in her new home, though it’s seductively shot on grainy film stock with deeply saturated colours. So she mopes around as her cousins swim and swing in blissful ignorance of the imploding world at large. Once the bombs go off and ash blankets what should be her newfound paradise, it’s not long before soldiers follow and the story makes a dramatic shift. Suddenly the idea of “home” takes on a much different meaning, and finding it again becomes more of an emotional journey than a physical one. Despite looking quite good, however, this adaptation of the award-winning young-adult novel by Meg Rosoff feels like it’s missing a few too many furnishings to be comfortable with itself. The characters, for one, amount to little more than their stock personas; nerdy cousin with glasses (Tom Holland), needy cousin with red hair (Harley Bird), handsome cousin to get naughty with (George Mackay). Moreover, the approach to genre is as confused as an angst-ridden adolescent, swinging wildly between moods and styles. The first few minutes of the film feel like an upbeat 70s rock ‘n roll film, before shifting into a European domestic drama, then an American summer camp movie, then a grim guerilla warfare film, and so on. By the time it all ended, I couldn’t really figure out who it was trying to please or where it really wanted to go. I certainly didn’t feel like I ended up in the same place as the people I followed.  Figuratively, anyway. It’s that tension proves to be How I Live Now’s biggest problem. It’s the characters we want to be constantly searching: the filmmakers need to settle somewhere and call it home.  Shouldn’t you have helped them with that?

Back to Middle Earth. Again. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug marks hours 12 to 15 of Peter Jackson’s adventures in Hobbit land, not including any of the extended DVD editions. Suffice to say, the visual wow factor that seduced audiences over a decade ago has long subsided. So it’s up to people like you to help evolve the look of the series. With the last film, Jackson’s big innovation was to introduce high frame rate (HFR) filmmaking. That decision, however, overwhelmed critical reactions to the film, which is why advance screenings of Smaug were only in standard 24 frames per second. So now, instead of looking like an episode of television, it just feels like one. It’s not an improvement. See, once we get past the two hour mark of this film, there’s this pending sense of dread that starts to set in. It has nothing to do with the dangers supposedly being faced by an invincible squadron of indistinguishable dwarves, who march up a hill to face Smaug the magic dragon. No, it’s the knowledge that each annoying tangent and delay tactic is a story decision made to withhold a climax. Call it fifty shades of not so great filmmaking. But I’ll give credit where it’s due. For the first time ever, a woman (Evangeline Lily) is given something to do – a conscious deviation from J.R.R. Tolkien’s female-phobic source material. She’s incredible with a bow, like all heroines these days, and develops a thing for the one non-dwarf-looking dwarf. This despite the fact that Legolas (Orlando Bloom) from the Lord of the Rings series shows up. That whole B-story is, of course, inconsequential to anything, but I could say the same thing for pretty much everything in the film. It’s a lot of “stuff” instead of story. But hey, at least some of it is cool stuff, right? Like, the barrels. When it comes to creating inventive action scenes, one of the first obstacles is always to have a memorable hook. The bobbing barrels down the river certainly qualifies, and an obligatory long take is sufficiently pleasing. But much like the first Tin Tin film, that scene felt like a misplaced highlight that was devoid of any real tension. In fact, the overall lack of consequences in this film is probably the most staggering part. But then of course, there’s Smaug/Necromacer. Whatever he’s called, he looks pretty great. And this is where you got to finally shine. The introduction of the dragon is also the only new standout visual for this film.  I have exactly no idea why Benedict Cumberbatch was required, since a) his voice is autotuned down two octaves anyway, and b) his motion-captured performance as a slithering monster is indistinguishably human (as it should be). But I guess you have to do something to make it feel like something in these three hours is new and special, not just a space-filling entry in an overblown mini-series, right? Oh, and about that. Casting both Sherlock and Watson here only reminds us of other, better literary adaptations.

As the baby girl in a family full of brothers, I was born fighting. My dad learned to box in the army and taught us all how to throw an uppercut. In this testosterone-heavy world I was never treated any differently from the boys but I can’t assume the same of you. All I can hope is that you have some sense of shame about contributing to a film that has only three female speaking roles, one being that of a prostitute. But hey, a job is a job, right? To introduce the audience to struggling steelworker Henry ‘Razor’ Sharpe (Sylvester Stallone) and cocky car dealership proprietor and publican, Billy ‘The Kid’ McDonnen (Robert DeNiro) at the height of their rivalry, you composed a montage of 70’s era magazine covers of the once-famous boxing champions at their fighting weight using actual photos of Sly and Bobby as their iconic alter-egos Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta.  Little did you know that with this simple cut and paste job you were helping knock our gender into last century.  Your hackneyed mosaic of People and Rolling Stone magazine shots transports us back to an age when Stallone and DeNiro were in their prime and didn’t make paycheque films to buy pools for the guest bungalows of their summer homes. An era when the rising feminist and gay rights battles gained serious ground and the overwhelming response of the male populace was to grow a ‘stache, wear tight, junk-hugging jeans and pursue manly endeavors like hi-fi stereo installation and mechanical bull riding. You strap us into the Wayback Machine against our will and with a heavy platform boot, you gun the gas and steer us straight into Macho Town - the Pittsburgh of Grudge Match - where its occupants probably think the Bechdel Test is something that measures one’s sperm count.  When Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart), the son of a Don King-esque fight impresario finds an opportunity to get Razor and Kid back in the ring for the fight that could net them all a huge purse, he’s met with resistance from Razor. Why? Because as Kid so eloquently puts it, “I banged his girlfriend and knocked her up.” Said girlfriend (Kim Basinger), with a backstory as thin as the dermis over Sly’s droopy right eye, is a plot device who exists only to emotionally support Razor and to provide Kid with the catalyst to become a better man through a relationship with their grown love child (Jon Bernthal). If films like Girl Fight, Million Dollar Baby, and The Fighter - with it’s rhinestone-studded, iron fisted matriarch - have taught us anything, it’s that it’s possible to tell a compelling story and still be successful without alienating half the audience. Perhaps Grudge Match screenwriter Tim Kelleher’s tenure writing and producing for Two And A Half Men has left him unable to construct a female character without reducing her to a crass punchline. Stallone and DeNiro took their training seriously and it pays off when we finally see them go mano-a-mano. To their credit, they move, act, and react their age, lending the film a dose of reality, however anemic. Unfortunately for them, and the ghosts of Rocky and Jake, this is the lone highlight in a film that is the cinematic equivalent of a cheap shot. I have a soft spot for underdog sports films and I’m a sucker for a cliched montage. Sadly, yours opens up a Mandora’s Box, spilling out lazy fart jokes, homophobic references, schoolyard comebacks, fat shaming, geriatric jabs and a scene at a monster truck show. In case the fruit wasn’t hanging low enough, there’s even a prison rape joke to remind us who the red-blooded, chest-thumping target audience is. I don’t want to sound like some butthurt feminist here, but if a Mike Tyson cameo is the least misogynistic part of your movie, you have a problem. Every fighter needs a good cut man, and your nostalgia-splicing made me wistful for those days as a child of the Seventies when I would run up my front steps, arms pumping as I triumphantly belted out Bill Conti’s Rocky theme. It didn’t matter that I was a girl, in my mind l was Rocky. In the spirit of all things macho I’ll say this, I like my boxing movies like I like my women: sharp, nuanced, and full of heart. Grudge Match isn’t a movie as much as it is a lame joke book for budding chauvinists and homophobes with ten minutes of solid ring action tacked on at the end. Witnessing the Italian Stallion and the Raging Bull duking it out provides the film’s only thrills but bobbing and weaving through 90-plus minutes of sexist, homophobic, sophomoric suckerpunches to get to ‘Grudgement Day’ left me feeling spiritually rope-a-doped.  Yours in the blue corner, Di Status: Junk Mail (1/5)"},{"title":"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues","url":"/2013/12/20/anchorman-2-the-legend-continues","date":"2013-12-20 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Vincent Cox II, Stand-in, He could have taught sexism to Black Jesus. He might have seduced Madam Curie—with science. Given the chance, he saved no orcas. Ron Burgundy is a unique character, full of possibilities. Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues, his newest outing, is a combination of hilarity, confusion, and disappointment. Was it worth it? I think so. Did maybe they need some more time to think the whole thing through? Yes. Well, maybe not much more time. Watching Will Ferrell’s and director Adam McKay’s new-old sequel (when it takes nine years to make a sequel, you are too early for Terence Malick or Star Wars, but way too late to be building any momentum). But, since the first movie was simply too weird and wonderful to not explore further, Ron Burgundy is. There’s not really a new story. Ron is once again saddled with the same sexism challenges, but instead of just threatening his career, this time it also threatens his marriage to his wife Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate).     In a bid to redeem himself, Ron puts his old crew back together. He finds Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Champ Kind (David Koechner), and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) and brings them to work with him for new 24-hour news agency GNN.  And that’s just the beginning of the introductions. This movie is full of characters. How many did you have to stand in for? Your job title explains so little, and you were the only one credited with it. That must have been exhausting. Can an overworked stand-in affect the performances of the cast? That could explain some of the inconsistency in Anchorman 2. As Chani, Brick’s love interest, Kristen Wiig was awesome.  On the other hand, I don’t know if Harrison Ford was good, or if he was just well edited. The others…I don’t want to give away too much, as the relentless pace of cameos is one of the film’s sole consistent pleasures. But as a result, no one element is really given much time. Except for the careful setup early on involving an RV crash with scorpions and bowling balls and deep fryer. But most everyone saw that in the commercials.  Otherwise, There’s not much time for plot, not much time for characters, and there’s not even much time for themes. We see the importance of parenting, Marshall McLuhan’s media, respect in relationships, interracial relationships, all of which are dismissed as quickly as they are introduced.   And in the end, the movie is just a lot of things. A string of sketches. An uneven sequence of laughs. Like an ode to late 70s/early 80s dining culture, it’s a buffet approach to comedy: Everyone can find something to enjoy. The guys next to me only laughed at the jokes about Filipinos and Blacks. One lady laughed at what I didn’t even think was a joke. Who was right? With a film this broad, it’s the people who laugh that win. And that was pretty much everyone. Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues desperately wants to be something to someone -  surprising, or weird, or awkward, or silly. All of the jokes are in this movie, and at least one of them is going to get broadcast directly to your fun brain.

I haven’t even seen all of Mary Poppins in one sitting, only in accumulated snippets over decades. This, is, I think, unusual, and so I come to all things Disney with a decidedly outsider point of view. The whole Disney experience—movies, TV shows, or theme parks*—is so carefully curated, so perfect, that I can’t fully buy into it. In this sense, I found myself completely aligned with author P. L. Travers in Saving Mr. Banks. And it’s specialists like you, Thomas, who are precisely the reason. Let me try to explain why. Saving Mr. Banks chronicles a two-week period in which Travers (Emma Thompson) travelled to Los Angeles to oversee the adaptation of her book Mary Poppins into the beloved film. Travers is fiercely protective of her work, and does not trust that Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) and his creative team will maintain her original vision, and instead turn it into one of his “silly cartoons.” I found it easy to see her reasoning. Interweaved throughout are flashbacks to Travers’ childhood, focusing on the relationship she had with her alcoholic father, Travers Goff (Colin Farrell). This experience is central to her formation: Goff continually encourages the young Travers’ imagination and love of fantasy, but is also an example of what can happen when you lose control of your own destiny. It’s not only Travers’ book and characters that she’s curating, but her entire persona. She has reasons to be protective. But back to you. Here’s a film production, Saving Mr. Banks, where it was deemed necessary that it was required that a dedicated person be brought on board to focus exclusively on the lighting of…Disneyland. For one scene.  Where Walt Disney has Travers’ driver (Paul Giamatti) take her for a tour, guided by Disney himself. The Disney Corporation is so protective of its own image that it won’t let just anyone light it’s parks: it needs a specialist dedicated to perpetuating every facet of its fantasy. The company is as much of a control freak as Travers is shown to be in the film. Which fantasy wins out in the end is a bit of a foregone conclusion, I suppose. In a movie about the making of a Walt Disney movie, released by the Walt Disney studio, there’s not going to be a lot of self-doubt and reflection from the mother corporation. I couldn’t help but feel Travers’ concerns (especially knowing from  where they come) were solved a little too neatly. Something this complex isn’t solve by a last-minute visits and insightful monologues. To give credit where it’s due, though, director John Lee Hancock almost pulls it all off, based largely on the strong performances of his cast. Thompson herself is makes the film work almost all by herself, but Hanks, Farrell, and Giamatti also leave a good impression. Bradley Whitford Jason Swartzman, and B. J. Novak – as the creative team working with Travers on the adaptation – bring enough exuberance that I was almost—almost—convinced that the Disney way was the right way after all. It’s all a little too simple, a little too perfect. Like a well-lit scene (or, ahem, theme park), the surfaces all appear perfect, shiny, and new. But it doesn’t take too much inspection for that facade to give way as life, in all its imperfection and ugliness, to show through. And although Saving Mr. Banks come close to making me believe it’s own brand of magic, it also reinforced that not everything fantastic holds up under close inspection. Turning off the lights on my way out, Casey Status: Standard Delivery (3/5) *The only counterfactual I have to offer is the time I have spent at Disney World as an adult.

The movie also celebrates underdogs, mind you, so who better address this letter to than you? Your short-lived performance embodied the humor with which the film tackles difficult issues, and marked a turning point in the movie’s plot.  The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, directed by and starring Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty, is based on a 1930s American short story about an insecure man who escapes the mundane through daydreaming. The novella was first made into a film in the 1940s, and now Hollywood has provided this 21st century adaptation in which Mitty is a forlorn middle-aged space cadet who works for Life magazine in New York. Mitty’s boss (Adam Scott) bullies him; he pines after a co-worker (Kristen Wiig) he dare not ask out.  Moreover, ‘Life’ is undergoing a series of tough changes: the magazine is going strictly online, publishing its last issue, and downsizing its staff.  When things seem like they couldn’t get worse, Mitty loses the negative for the last issue’s cover photo. Desperate to save his job, and longing to break free from a colorless life, Mitty resolves to find the cover picture’s photographer (Sean Penn) to retrieve the lost negative.  The photographer’s a daredevil who’s always on the go, so Mitty must travel the world to find him. Enter horny Chilean sailors.  You dock in a remote port in Iceland at the same time as Mitty, who’s searching for his photographer.  But you’re searching for the nearest strip-joint.  In the port, a lone bicycle offers the only means of transportation.  You charge for the bike, emboldened by your voracious sexual appetites, but Mitty grabs it first and rides off, emboldened by his desire to live a meaningful life.  Up until this point, Mitty was a fainthearted character. But racing horny Chilean sailors, and winning, inadvertently reignites his desire to sink his teeth into life.  Your scene embodies the humorous way The Secret Life of Walter Mitty depicts how a depressed individual comes into his own, but it also highlights the important role that underdogs play in shaping outcomes in life. Indeed, that’s one of the movie’s messages: everybody counts; everybody has a part to play in the larger scheme of things… whether you’re a horny Chilean sailor who’s just come back from sea or a middle-aged geek who’s looking for adventure. In its subplot, the movie addresses hard topics like coping with a loved one’s death, or with debilitating insecurity; but it does so in a light-hearted inspirational way.  By way of example, as I exited the movie theatre, a man and woman from the crowd in front of me were playfully spanking each other, which spoke volumes about the film’s uplifting effect. I can’t imagine playful spanks after Dancer in the Dark or Schindler’s List. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a finely executed Hollywood comedy with your typical blend of action, romance, and a moralistic happy ending. There’s nothing particularly brilliant about it; but it’s not too shabby either.  With strong performances, nice scenery, and a solid soundtrack with songs by the likes of David Bowie and Arcade Fire, the movie holds its own. There’s just one major discrepancy: the movie urges viewers to live life to the fullest, yet to see the film you have to sit inactively for hours on end in a dark cinema, living vicariously through improbable fictional characters.  While Walter Mitty transforms into a man of action on screen, viewers are transform into Mitty’s former self, dreaming life away… Perplexed, Katherine Status: Air Mail (3.5/5)"},{"title":"American Hustle","url":"/2013/12/31/american-hustle","date":"2013-12-31 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Kathrine Gordon, Department Head Hair Stylist, David O. Russell’s American Hustle opens with a scene in which Christian Bale, playing conman Irving Rosenfeld, laboriously styles an impressive combover designed by you. This ritual is clearly part of his warm-up before a con, his way of building up his own confidence before working on a mark’s. We’re never really sure if he thinks he’s fooling anyone – that bald spot is just too big to hide – but that’s kind of the point. As an audience, we’re being set up for the long con, never sure when someone is genuine or not, and whether they know we know they’re being genuine or not. That’s both the fun and frustration of American Hustle.  Set in late 70s New York, American Hustle is a sort-of-true, sort-of-made-up (an introductory title card playfully states “Some of this actually happened.”) tale inspired by the real FBI “Abscam” sting operation. Rosenfeld, a glass salesman/dry-cleaning owner/conman, specializes in duping desperate people into paying him advances on loans that don’t exist. It’s a disco-era version of today’s email scams except his partner, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), pretends to be a British bank executive instead of a deposed Nigerian prince.  The trick to making people want to give you their money, Rosenfeld says, is to say “No” over and over. The more you say it, the more they want to give you their money. When someone finally does says no back to them, it’s FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), who uses the threat of jail time to force Rosenfeld and Prosser into working for him, using their skills to catch bigger fish. Obsessed with making a name for himself in the bureau, DiMaso keeps upping the ante, from small time hoods to local congressmen state senators, and even the Mafia. Pulled into this is Camden, New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) and Rosenfeld’s wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). But back to the hair. Everyone has been given their own, special, character-driven do. DiMaso, desperate to keep control of his life and career, wears a tight perm. Prosser’s wavy curls convey the elegance she wishes she had. Polito’s Elvis-style pompadour marks him as a man of the people. Rosalyn’s jumbled tresses are indicative of her character’s instability. I know all that sounds a little simplistic, like a rushed first-year film theory paper. The characters of American Hustle are more subtly defined than that. Mostly. For all the backstory Russell and writer Eric Singer have given their characters, for all the multiple voice-overs employed to earn our sympathies, they are quick to abandon character consistency when it suits a given moment. This is especially for Cooper and Lawrence. The main directorial note given to both of them seems to have been “Crazy!” The result is two characters with no internal logic, who act in ways that don’t make sense from scene to scene. Motivations are vague or completely absent, creating confusion when clarity is needed. Add to that Russell’s love of actors yelling at each other in Long Island accents, and American Hustle has too many scenes that feel like acting workshops more than character moments. (Lawrence, who does solid work with what she has, is hung out to dry a few times).  Thankfully more of American Hustle works than doesn’t. As Rosenfeld, Bale takes a physically ridiculous figure and gives him real depth and the film its centre. Adams gives Prosser the right combination of sadness, sexiness, and neediness. Renner’s Polito earns the most sympathy as a man a little toowilling to compromise his ethics for the benefit of his constituents. And although it may owe a little too much to Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Russell’s more-is-more approach to acting, editing, and, well, everything, means that if one scene doesn’t work, something completely different isn’t too far away. You just have to try and forget all the scenes that don’t work, which I couldn’t. And in a movie about the con –- the ones we play on ourselves as well as others – everything needs to hold together as the credits roll. It all needs to make sense in the rear view, so you walk away believing. As hard as it works to keep everything in place, American Hustle ends with enough loose strands that it looks a little too thrown together instead of what it wants to be: elegant.

Over the years, as make-up techniques have advanced, filmmakers have found themselves with more tools to work with, and actors, unburdened, are able to perform with more subtlety.  But one particular specialization seems to have remained for the large part un-evolved: old age make-up. I’m not blaming you for this, Stephen. It’s just something that’s always bothered me. Seeing actors struggling to emote while encased in fake wrinkles, jowls, and wigs is, at best, distracting—and, at worst, depressing. We have come a long way from Dustin Hoffman’s mummified face in Little Big Man, but we haven’t come far enough; old-age prosthetics sacrifice life and subtlety for surface detail. And this is exactly the problem with Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. Director Justin Chadwick’s adaptation of Nelson Mandela’s autobiography takes on so much of Mandela’s life that it is never able to break the surface. It’s a collection of scenes that provides a nice overview, but far too little insight. It’s not that the material wasn’t there. Both Idris Elba, as Nelson Mandela, and Naomi Harris, as his second wife Winnie, give great performances—almost worth the price of admission alone. Particularly in the early scenes, they shine: Mandela begins as a lawyer more interested in hitting the bars and chasing girls than becoming a voice in the anti-apartheid movement, and, eventually, a leader of the early African National Congress.  Elba is one of the few actors who could convey both the anger and charisma that drew people to Mandela. It’s a side of Mandela not many may be familiar with, and, better developed, would have made his transformation into the recently deified figure that much more striking.  Instead, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom expands its scope and tries to be two things at once: a summary of Mandala’s life and the story of his disintegrating relationship with Winnie. Once Mandela begins his decades-long imprisonment, Chadwick divides the film between Nelson and Winnie, using Winnie’s story as a means to illustrate the utter chaos and horror South Africa went through in the 70s and 80s. But the more content the film tries to include, the more it sags under its own weight. No moment is given proper time to develop and therefore has little impact. And, as the years pass—and the latex piles on—Mandela is reduced to speaking in platitudes, and our attention is lost in an awkward attempt to find the visual middle ground between Elba’s and Mandela’s faces. The movie stiffens along with Elba’s face.  The effect is to render Mandela a passive figure in his own life. Chadwick isn’t able to find a way to dramatize Mandela’s personal transformation. That is certainly the harder story to tell cinematically, but it is also the central story to Mandela’s life. And as Chadwick focuses on events occurring outside the prison walls, he keeps returning to Mandela in scenes that increasingly feel like prison visits, each lasting only long enough for Mandela to espouse some vague piece of wisdom before moving on. We know there’s a lot more to Mandela than that. It’s a tribute to Elba’s performance that even under all that weight, his fire and intelligence manage to shine through at all. But all too often he is left to suffocate beneath the mask you crafted. In ignoring the illuminating details of Mandela’s journey, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom stumbles long before it arrives at its destination.

After living a life of remorseless debauchery, having swindled untold thousands, getting busted, serving time, and then documenting it all in the inevitable tell-all book, you now find yourself the focus of a Martin Scorsese film! You could even say that you’re the hero of the piece, since your onscreen alter ego (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) appears in almost every scene. If you believe some of the critical reaction, it would also seem that this is exactly what’s wrong with The Wolf of Wall Street. Here is a film that shows the worst of…well, pretty much everything—yet offers no judgment, establishes no true north on the moral compass so that audiences can guide themselves through the despicable proceedings. Scorsese even goes so far as to cast you in a small role. Is this a tip of the hat to you? Are the filmmakers tacitly approving your actions? It’s a ridiculous argument. It assumes a level of knowledge about who you are that is unlikely for anyone who doesn’t do a little research beforehand (I only realized that you played the part while browsing the credits afterward). No, this extra-textual information has no bearing on the film itself. Lets talk, instead, about what’s actually happens in The Wolf of Wall Street. It’s an epic that exhaustively details your rise from wannabe Wall Street broker to president of a multi-billion dollar firm built on the pumping and dumping of penny stocks, primarily on those who can’t afford the losses. Profit-wise, Stratton Oakmont is pretty small-scale by Wall Street standards (the head office was in Long Island). But it afforded you enough to indulge in whatever depravity you could think up. And, boy, could you think up a lot. This is a slimy story, told about (and with, and by) pure adrenaline.  Scorsese  and screenwriter Terence Winter show their hand right away. Instead of starting chronologically with your early, earnest years, they cut right to you at your hedonistic, self-satisfied worst—all described in an energetic DiCaprio voice-over. It not only prepares the audience for what’s to come, but also serves as a kind of advanced warning: with you as our only guide, we’re going to have to do the heavy lifting when it comes to interpreting what we see. It’s a lot to ask of an audience. It’s also incredibly entertaining. That’s the thing with The Wolf of Wall Street—it doesn’t pretend that these aren’t charismatic, funny characters. And the casting further stacks the deck: Dicaprio, Jonah Hill, Rob Reiner, and Matthew McConaughey (in a small role that is essentially a masturbation-obsessed version of Alec Baldwin’s “Man from Downtown” in Glengarry Glenross). And after DiCaprio (ie. you) dumps his first wife in favour of a younger, blonder model (Margot Robbie), few characters are left to earn our sympathies. Only Kyle Chandler, as an FBI investigator, provides any sort of navigation, and his straight-arrow life is shown to be pretty miserable.  The Wolf of Wall Street is funny. Really funny. More than once I found myself horrified at the antics at which I was laughing out loud. A mid-film set piece that involves a late night ride to the country club and far too many quaaludes is the funniest scene I saw all year. DiCaprio showcases a heretofore unknown, Tati-like knack for physical comedy.  But Scorsese’s been around this block before. He knows enough about the charisma of powerful, terrible men to allow himself to be seduced by it. As The Wolf of Wall Street passes the two-hour mark, it becomes a lot less fun. Not because the characters aren’t enjoying themselves – I’m sure you were still quite happy with your life – but the unceasing repetition becomes numbing: drug-fuelled orgies become boring; foul-mouthed motivational speeches feel stale, by-the-numbers. While it’s not the most fun for an audience, it’s all by Scorsese’s, (and Winters’ and editor Thelma Schoonmaker’s) design. An audience needs to get sick of you and your near-sociopathic cronies to gain any sort of context. It’s how the audience finally gets free of your twisted point of view. And that’s what it really boils down to in The Wolf of Wall Street: it’s told through your eyes. Every time Scorsese sneaks in a genuine shock (say, a crime scene photograph of a broker’s suicide) you’re there to brush it aside with a quick “Anyway…” The filmmaker’s voice is constantly fighting against yours, which is ultimately makes the picture so remarkable.  As much as you may have thought you owned the world, this isn’t really your movie, is it? It’s Scorsese’s, and he gets the last word. In that final scene, when you make your cameo, the final shot of the film implicates not only you, but all of us. That’s The Wolf of Wall Street’s last and best joke: that the victims want you to keep conning them so they might someday learn how to con someone else.  (Hopefully) seeing it clearly, -Casey Status: Priority Post (4.5/5)   "},{"title":"Lone Survivor","url":"/2014/01/09/lone-survivor","date":"2014-01-09 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Timothy C. Sullivan, Development Executive, You’re in the hero-making business, I know. Hollywood executives like you trip all over themselves to bring a story like Marcus Luttrell’s to the screen. He’s a real-life Navy SEAL who, in 2005, was caught in a fierce firefight during U.S. operations in Afghanistan and, despite being severely, injured, lived to tell the tale (let’s agree that it’s impossible to spoil a movie called Lone Survivor). And the tale, which Luttrell later told in the book he co-authored, is certainly harrowing stuff. Almost every major studio in Tinseltown bid on the rights. But you won, Timothy. And you did exactly what every other studio would have done: created a flag-waving, testosterone-heavy, obnoxiously earnest love-letter to the U.S. military. Well, hooah! Director Peter Berg wastes little time fawning over the discipline and endurance required to cut it as a SEAL. The opening credit sequence is composed entirely of real boot camp footage, where men are pushed to the breaking point and those who can’t cut it are forced to ring a brass bell three times to announce to the world that they’ve washed out. The emotions are real, the pain is visceral, and I would have loved to watch that documentary for 90-minutes. But instead we watch four bearded Hollywood actors pretending to be brothers-in-arms long past their training days. In some ways, that opening sequence almost sets them up to fail. Thus begins our slice-of-life section of the film, which you no doubt considered obligatory after reading all those do-it-yourself screenwriting books stashed in your office. We learn that some of the guys have girlfriends, or wives, or families, and that everyone is basically a really good person. But here’s the biggest problem: in a story that can’t really foreshadow plot, set up antagonists, or give any of these doomed patriots a proper character arc without losing all credibility, you ended up with a fragmented film that feels like it’s spinning its wheels for the first 30 minutes. The only real suspense is finding out which of these characters will get tangled up in the fateful Operation Redwing (though, if you recognize the actor, that’s a pretty good hint). Mark Walhberg, as the film’s star, is of course a shoe-in for the mission (as the opening flash-forward confirms). I’ll admit, he’s an actor I often like. But I don’t love him like you clearly do. After only a year as a development executive, this is already your third film with him (after Broken City and 2 Guns). And unfortunately, as in those other efforts, he seems to be giving you exactly the minimum amount required for the role. In fact, like all the characters in the film (Taylor Kitch, Emile Hirsh, Ben Foster, etc), no matter how much they talk about wanting to buy Arabian horses for their fiancées or just “pay the bills,” we never really care about them until they start taking a beating. That’s where the film really picks up, when the action begins to speak louder than the clichés. See, this film was undoubtedly bought and sold (and subsequently made) on two compelling plot points. The first: a decision the men have to make when they stumble upon a group of Afghan farmers who might give away their position. The second plot point kicks us into the third act. I won’t spell it out (ok, maybe you can spoil a movie called Lone Survivor), but it’s a moment of great importance, and is relevant to the very title of the film. Yet for some reason, its execution feels strangely weightless and glossed-over. As it stands, the most memorable scenes are the obvious ones: the soldiers taking inhuman leaps from high cliffs and absorbing ungodly amounts of bullets. It’s impossible not to feel for them, but with nothing of substance – no mood or energy or thoughtfulness – outside of the slam-bang action scenes, the whole film feels a little too staged. But I guess that’s just how you Hollywood execs see the theatre of war.

We’re talking George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling. But I’m curious to know: how did it feel to finally work with the greatest onscreen hair of all time? No, not Jack Nicholson. Not Christopher Lloyd. Sure, they come close to claiming the title, but I’m talking about the one actor you seek out when you need a shock of hair that conveys a psyche a few steps left of normal: Bruce Dern. Casual observers may think that a snow-white plume of crazy would be easy to handle, but they’d be wrong. Like everything else in this film, what seems simply on the surface conceals an underlying complexity. No splashy, sentimental performances. No outrageous plot twists. No CGI. Just regular folks reckoning with their circumstances, quietly, with dignity, and suffused with director Alexander Payne’s signature dry wit. In Nebraska, Dern (and his hair) play stubborn alcoholic Woody Grant, an easily-confused septuagenarian intent on cashing in a magazine sweepstakes certificate that has declared him a millionaire. He’s fixated on getting to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his “winnings,” and youngest son David (Will Forte), his own life in a rut and seeking to connect with his gruff father, offers to drive him there. But an unplanned stop in Woody’s hometown brings the extended Grant family together and news of his jackpot reignites old grudges. It’s easy to forget just how good Dern – whose manic visage has seen him cast as sociopaths and raving lunatics in forgettable b-movies – has been in other films (They Shoot Horses Don’t They, Coming Home, etc.). The Oscar buzz surrounding him this year is justified and overdue. He’s not a psychopath or creep, here, but a regular joe born in the shadow of the Greatest Generation and grasping desperately for his last chance at the American Dream. Woody’s tragicomic determination has a certain quixotic quality to it; his steed is his son’s Subaru, his helmet the unkempt cirrus you and your hairdressing team so carefully crafted. When father and son are taking in Mount Rushmore, Woody comments, “Looks like somebody got bored doing it”, and you get the feeling he’s talking about his own life. This is the fourth film that Payne has set in his home state of Nebraska, and he takes advantage of the unapologetic mundaneness without glorifying it. The melancholy in the black and white cinematography feels appropriate; in Payne’s Nebraska there are no box stores or franchises, no clothes that aren’t plaid ,and, with one notable exception, no cars newer than ten years old. It’s Napoleon Dynamite without the irony. This type of period piece/not-a-period-piece presents its own set of challenges, though, especially when it comes to hairstyles. Hair, as you know, can date a film faster than an outfit or a song (see any 80’s movie for proof). It takes skill to make actors look like ordinary people and make ordinary people look like movie stars (Payne uses a lot of non-actors in speaking roles).  Kudos for reflecting Nebraska’s honesty and making it all look effortless. While theatres this winter are full of funky disco-coiffes (American Hustle, Anchorman 2) and $200 haircuts (Wolf of Wall Street). it’s the Mrs. Claus comb-and-curl of Woody’s wife Kate, played by June Squibb, that belies the most outrageous character of the season. She berates her family as fiercely as she defends it. She has no social filters, curses, judges, and flashes the grave of an old flame. It would have been easy to resort to caricature when styling these flyover-state folks, but instead you and Payne have given us an authenticity and unaffectedness that reveals the residents of Nebraska to be real people with simple problems. No casino capers or political intrigue here, just the slow, soul-wrenching acceptance of one’s own mortality and it’s resulting isolation. And, of course, the greatest onscreen hair of all time, perhaps soon to get the recognition it (and its owner) deserves.

There are a number of considerations — buildings, vehicles, and of course, your specialty, fashion. Do you borrow from the past and create a retro-chic look? Maybe go high tech/low power-source for a modern steampunk approach? How about creating something sleek and shiny from whole cloth? In a pinch, of course, you can always opt for jumpsuits. As the fashion consultant for Spike Jonze’s new film Her, which takes place in an unspecified future, you opted for something subtler: high-waisted pants. Okay, that’s oversimplifying your contribution quite a bit. However, it does speak to Jonze’s approach as writer and director. Everything—like those pants—is just different enough to register as slightly beyond our current context. Most of the future is just small, logical extrapolations of what is already familiar: technology is a touch sleeker, transportation is cleaner, and people are even more preoccupied with their mobile devices than they are today. Keeping the future simple is important because Her’s premise is a doozy; the sorted love affair between a man and his operating system. When Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Pheonix) installs the “the world’s first artificially intelligent operating system” on his computer, it almost immediately configures itself to use a female voice (Scarlett Johansson’s, to be exact), naming itself Samantha. The two start up a professional, if casual relationship. As Samantha performs routine tasks such as reading emails and copy editing his work, Theodore starts to develop real feelings for her. In fact, the blossoming love goes both ways. Although Samantha is quick to point out that she is only doing what her creators programmed her to do, both she and Theodore start to realize that they have a real connection. Or at least a connection that feels real. In Jonze’s future, life is disconnected to the point that people knowingly let others define their existence. Theodore himself works as a writer at Beautiful Handwritten Letters, a service specializing in drafting heartfelt, personal messages sent to husbands and wives, sons and daughters, and all other personal relations. The thing is, the inauthenticity of these seems to be acknowledged by both the senders and recipients. Theodore manages the personal interactions the same way a system utility would organize files and folders. When the personal can be taken out of interpersonal relationships, taking the actual person out isn’t much of a stretch. After all, the same way a strange new fashion becomes normalized over time, so does behaviour. One of the surprising elements in Her is not just the central relationship itself, but people’s reaction to it. Theodore’s longtime friend Amy (Amy Adams, seemingly relaxed to finally playing an actual person instead of a capital-C Character) similarly finds solace in her operating system, as it helps her through issues of her own. She is delighted and curious, if not a bit jealous, that Theodore and Samantha’s relationship has become intimate. Her does not so much ask us to gawk at this strange scenario, but instead draws a map showing how we might get to that point. Only Theodore’s soon to be ex-wife Catherine (Rooney Mara) calls him out on the relationship, accusing him of taking the easy path, creating a surrogate that fits his ideal. Jonze isn’t preaching through Catherine, though; Samantha isn’t quite so easily defined. Like the other newly installed self-aware operating systems, Samantha isn’t cognizant of her own potential. As she becomes increasingly more sure of herself, the relationship grows both more human and more confounding to Theodore. It would be too pat to say that through his relationship with a computer, Theodore realizes that he needs other people. Jonze is thankfully above that. He’s curious about what a true connection is—physical, mental, emotional, or something else altogether—and the way it never follows the easy path you expect. He’s also interested in solid storytelling with compelling characters, whether they appear onscreen or not. And that’s always in fashion.

But it’s amazing how few films truly embrace this fundamental principle as effectively as Drug War. Chinese director Johnnie To has created a riveting thriller that plays like a master class in visual communication. The script has plenty of great dialogue scenes, but not a single word is wasted on something that is better off shown. As a result, I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen from the very first scene. That’s the sign of a great film. We open on the image of a car screeching through the streets. The driver is passing out at the wheel with chemical burn marks all over his face before crashing into a crowded restaurant. Cut to border crossing in mainland China, where a bus full of sick and nervous passengers run away when they’re pulled over. During the chase, one of the escapees drop-kicks a fellow fugitive. The fancy footwork is from an undercover cop (Sun Honglei), who soon after revealing himself, has to watch these drug mules excrete their tiny balloons of crystal meth under excruciating pain. This quickly connects back to the original driver, who is discovered to be a drug cartel Lord named Timmy Choi (Louis Koo). After a feverish chase through the hospital, he agrees to expose his supply network to avoid the death penalty.  But no one can see just how far his connections go. You, of course, were hired to help in the sequences with the Dumb Brothers (as the English credits call them), deaf drug manufacturers who only communicate through sign. That quirk in a couple of secondary characters would be enough for most filmmakers, but not Johnnie To. We’re introduced to “Senior Dumb” in a short five-second shot where he’s showering with a bulletproof vest on. Seriously, what more could I hope to learn about the guy? His paranoia and preparedness is all the foreshadowing needed for the character. His actions say everything – even more than the sign language. They’re almost like the numerical telephone code used by the drug dealers, which only allows for essential key words. It’s not an issue; the interpreters simply fill in the obvious prepositions, pronouns and articles. I can almost imagine the screenplay written the same way. Forget the flowery adjectives. Stick to bold nouns, blunt verbs, and make everything in the present tense. Exposition, banter and back-story be damned. And amen to that. Yet one of the most memorable sequences involves a mostly verbal confrontation between the undercover officer and upper members of the drug ring. Sure, it borrows a lot from the hotel room masquerade in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, but by not spelling out what’s about to unfold or the full potential of the characters, the dramatic tension is huge and the comedic pay-offs come as complete surprises. Kind of like the whole of Drug War, which delivers its story with a confidence most other Hollywood films fake worse than a South African interpreter at a Nelson Mandela memorial. Too soon?

Casting is an under-appreciated part of that. “We need a hooker with a heart of gold.” “We need nice old lady with a secret.” “We need a person. With an accent.” Your job is to put a face to nothing but a few words on a page. A shadow. And so this year, playing the role of James Bond, as Jason Bourne, as Jack Reacher, is Jack Ryan, the Shadow Recruit. That’s the whole movie, a series of disappointing encounters on a re-casting couch for better movies.   Since Clancy is now dead, and he never actually wrote this, he is obviously cast as the author. Or is it the Shadow Author? All things considered, he does his job pretty well. This action movie plays the role of a Clancy techno-thriller reasonably well, as long as no one looks too closely at the gear. As for the hero and title, I was always cautious about this casting of Jack Ryan as a movie hero. In the books, he often didn’t do anything pivotal, but he was there when it went down. This was even reflected in some of the movies, with Jack Ryan thrust into situations he was unprepared for. That was part of his charm. In Shadow Recruit, the author’s nerd, played by an unlikely action hero, seems to be played by a cross between a space ninja and pretty-boy robocop (even if he’s only acting like one: Movie Magic!).  Don’t get me wrong. I think you did quite a good job casting this movie with people. Chris Pine, playing the role of Sam Worthington circa 2010, the man who was in every single movie you saw that year, excels. He has charisma and enthusiasm, and it’s enjoyable to watch him fall into the spy business and watch his world get turned upside down. Kiera Knightly and Kevin Costner play timeless roles of lover and mentor that any hero needs.  It was a little sketchy with Kenneth Branagh, though. He was well cast as the villain, a Russian Hans Gruber. He delivers his lines with relish, and the camera gives him lots of attention. Unfortunately, that’s because the role of Director of the Movie is played by a cautious film student also played by Branagh. The conflict is clear. Deborah, you should have cast someone else in the role of John McTiernan or Paul Greengrass. Just a thought. Since the story, directions, and roles are pretty much simulated, it’s clear that soon they’ll be doing this kind of movie alchemy with computers. “What if Meryl Streep played a Nazi Lieutenant played by Brad Pitt? Please wait. Loading…” You worry about your job, and we will worry about the movies we’ll have to see.

The first (and perhaps most essential) challenge is to find a frictionless way to expand the story from the confines of the stage without resorting to gimmickry or novelty. The original staging of August: Osage County by Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theater featured multiple rooms of a vast farmhouse, each illuminated and darkened as characters moved from place to place. To give himself a little room to breathe in his film adaptation, director John Wells does the usual things: transposes conversations to other locations, lingers on big, beautiful shots of bruise-colored prairie cloudscapes and tall grass moving in waves, and throws in a few appended scenes (that the screenplay is written by the play’s author, Tracy Letts, makes these interstitial feel a little criminal). But the success of August: Osage County is less about scope than it is about richness—and that’s the second big challenge in bringing theater to the movies: how do you show the richness of the world in a manner that befits the particular strengths of cinema? And how do you do it without losing the value inherent in the original piece of art? In a way, its not that different from adapting a comic book, or video game, or board game, or breakfast cereal, etc. You find what is elemental in the source material, and you exploit it in new ways. So, what is elemental in August: Osage County?  You might argue that it’s Letts’ script. It’s all the southern gothic stuff of Tennessee Williams (with a dash of Eugene O’Neill’s domestic strife): a patriarch goes missing and draws back to the homestead three daughters and their respective families to do battle with the widow: a venom-spitting harpy, fuelled by pills and self-pity who seems dedicated not to reconciliation but to its opposite. She’s larger-than-life and pathetic, devoted to her family and unspeakably cruel to them. “I’m just truth-telling,” she says at one point. “And some people are antagonized by the truth.” But it makes about as much sense to follow the script of a play word-for-word as it does for a comic book movie to be built verbatim from the dialogue in word balloons. So you might argue, instead, that the performances are that elemental thing. After all, superlatives can no longer account for Meryl Streep’s impossible-to-fathom talent, and Julia Roberts somehow manages to keep pace – and in some scenes exceed! – Streep’s self-destructive radiance. But the performances alone, as wonderful as they are, don’t account for how well the story plays out in the world of film. In a stage play, actors have nowhere to go; the sense of claustrophobia is what lends the medium so well to domestic dramas. The one thing theater can’t modulate with the same effectiveness as movies is ambience. And it just so happens that ambience – the mood and atmosphere and ecology of this old farmhouse and the surrounding Great Plains – is the essential element of Tracy Letts’ play. And that, Ceri, is where I think you contributed to making August: Osage County the best film of 2013. When Julia Roberts (the eldest daughter) and her family first arrive at the Oklahoma farmhouse, they complain about the heat, and beneath their voices we hear the electric hum and tick of insects, the whisper of far-off cars, and the dull drone of wind (even the wind sounds hot). Later, during, one of the most uncomfortable (and uncomfortably comical) family dinners ever filmed, the quiet chiming of cutlery scores the increasingly vitriolic back-and-forth—and when the sound of it disappears altogether, we don’t need a wide shot to see that everyone has stopped eating. When Streep, delirious from painkillers, dances to Eric Clapton’s “Lay Down Sally”, the absurdity of her wild movements is subverted when the song slowly drops from the soundtrack, and, in the same way that laughing and crying are often indistinguishable, we suddenly can’t tell if she’s celebrating or grieving. The sound design is perfect, and so is the mix. A story like this, which relies so heavily on machine gun exchanges of dialogue – and, just as vitally, on the beats of stunned silence between – is all about tempo, and the care that was put into the way the voices, music, sound beds, and foley effects work together is indicative a movie that aspired to be something more than merely a filmed play. Despite its lofty, prize-winning origins (and the expectations that come with it), August: Osage County is, through and through, a motion picture, and there wasn’t a better one released this year.

As a Canadian, I’ve probably experienced all of them. This puts you and your work at a serious disadvantage. Film fans like me who live in a Northern climate know fake snow when we see it. We also have a complicated relationship with the white wonder. Kids eagerly anticipate the first snowfall, dreaming of school closures. Adults slog to work in the half-snow/half-rain slop that always manages to trickle an icy path down the back of your neck regardless of how well you bundle up.

Immediately upon taking up residence in her new home, Liesel meets love-struck Rudy (Nico Liersch), the literal boy next door, who becomes her best friend.

As the tense situation for Jews in Germany escalates, a young man named Max (Ben Schnetzer) shows up on Hans and Rosa’s doorstep and they offer to shelter him in their basement. When Max becomes ill, Liesel, now an avid reader, steals books to read to Max as he convalesces. It is here, in the darkest days of the war, that Liesel clings to humanity through the wonder of storytelling. The film spans several years, and you sprinkle the sets with snow to denote the passage of time. Opening with a sweeping shot of a train racing on snow-covered tracks, a title card reads ‘Germany, February 1938’. This kind of vagueness sets up a film that brushes past details in favour of a broad-strokes Nazi movie for the whole family. The film is narrated by Death himself, a harsh tactic for younger audiences made palatable by the disembodied voice’s cross between Marvin the Paranoid Android and Ringo Starr’s Thomas the Tank Engine. Hans and Rosa, on the other hand, are from the Anne of Green Gables School of Adoptive Parents – a Teutonic Matthew and Marilla – he, the kind-hearted pushover, she the frosty task-master with a soft, marzipan center. When Liesel and Rudy race through the streets of their painfully obvious movie-set town, it’s meant to allude to their disappearing innocence and ends with them skidding into your carefully piled mound of ersatz slush. It’s not a fluffy snowbank, but an icy impediment to their freedom. Only children and simple-minded adults won’t find these tropes as subtle as a snowball to the face.  If you look at a snowbank in the middle of winter you will see striations - layer upon layer of snow as it’s fallen and settled. Layering detail could have benefited both character and story development here. Liesel runs along your snowy riverbank after Rudy has jumped into the icy waters to retrieve her book and then they both walk home normally - no shivering, no chattering teeth, no visible breath. The characters speak in English with German accents and sometimes (inexplicably) switch over to German with subtitles, a conceit that sticks out as sorely as Spielberg’s Girl in the Red Coat. We also don’t know what Liesel and her mother’s relationship was like, what Hans and Rosa’s backstories are, or how Max came to knock on their door – omissions that will surely perturb fans of The Book Thief novel. This film is at its best when it strives for Empire of the Sun and Hope and Glory levels of World War II coming-of-age realism. There’s the moment where Hans tearfully admonishes himself for trying to keep a Jewish neighbour from being carted off knowing that for his trouble he might be next. Or when Liesel befriends the Beurgmeister’s wife who has lost a son in the war and her fondness for the young girl is tinged with sorrow. Sadly, such moments are few and far between. A highlight for you must have been the scene involving Liesel and Hans carting buckets of snow to the basement for Max, who has been confined indoors for months. They find a few moments of fun together throwing snowballs and building a snowman, with even the dour Rosa joining in. Your snow is used to remind this surrogate family what normal is, and it’s one of the film’s most poignant scenes.  But in the end, The Book Thief too badly wants to deliver a little something for everyone. It’s a lofty motivation that unfortunately ends up like one your slush-filled puddles; murky, shallow and soggy.

No pressure, right Dawn? Inside Llewyn Davis follows a talented folksinger (Oscar Isaac) as he trudges through his daily struggle to survive in 1961 New York. He’s constantly alienating people and ruining his personal and professional relationships, until it seems like only your cat is left to redeem him. The pet of friends that he inadvertently lets escape its apartment, Davis’ concern over returning the cat is often the audience’s only clue that Davis may have once been a good person.  There are many scenes of people telling Davis how awful he is: Carey Mulligan’s perpetually angry Jean in particular, though she has good reason – she’s pregnant after a regrettable fling with Davis.  We see him throwing away opportunities and being cruel to those who don’t meet his exacting and sometimes contradictory standards for authentic music. In other words, he’s a jerk.  But then there’s the cat, and we see Davis cuddling it or desperately searching for it, even taking it along on his last ditch road trip to see a music manager in Chicago.  In those moments it’s possible to see Davis not as a perpetual loser deserving of his fate, but as a damaged person, still reeling from the death of his singing partner, and exhausted from the grind of singing his heart out and failing to connect.  The structure of Inside Llewyn Davis is circular but feels more like a spiral as Davis’ options narrow.  There’s the sense that he’s trapped in this cycle, that the change we know is coming – Bob Dylan is waiting in the wings to electrify the folk scene – will pass Davis by.  There’s not a lot of hope, but then there’s that cat again, whose name reveal near the end of the movie gives us just a sense that sometimes a journey back to where you began is not a bad thing. The cat represents many things – it drives the narrative, it could be symbol of Davis’ lost partner, or the elusive nature of art itself. Losing and finding the cat is therefore something we and Llewyn Davis feel strongly about. Well that, and because it’s also a pretty cute cat. There was a lot riding on your shoulders, Dawn (and those of your cats), but you managed to pull it off brilliantly.

I was half a world away, watching events unfold on the nine o’clock news, marvelling at the sheer size of the crowd gathered in Cairo’s Tahrir Square. The images were loud and chaotic, but the commentary was composed, measured, and detached. Watching the same events play out in Jehane Noujaim’s documentary The Square was an entirely different experience.  I saw some of the same footage, the same iconic images that had made the rounds of traditional media outlets, but packaged so differently, I felt like I was seeing them for the first time. Filmed between 2011 and 2013, The Square follows a small group of Egyptian revolutionaries at the heart of the Arab Spring. From the end of the Mubarak regime to the country’s first democratic election in over 30 years, to the Muslim Brotherhood’s rise to power, we witness moments of elation, disillusionment, and confrontations with staggering brutality at the hands of the Egyptian military. With the film crew’s footage supplemented by YouTube videos and frantic bursts recorded on smart phones, I couldn’t help but think about the monumental task before you and your co-editors. Not only did you have to piece together a coherent narrative of a revolution, you had to construct the story around Tahrir Square, and through the wildly divergent opinions of the subjects, explain the role of the Square itself in the events that unfold. First, you show us what brought the people to Tahrir Square in the first place. The working class hero, the returned expatriate, the Islamist, the feminist, and the musician all make their way there to demand regime change.  The Square becomes a modern day agora, the exchange of goods, ideologies, and opinions in full swing. The optimistic energy of the opening scenes ebbs as the people settle in for the long haul, refusing to leave the square until their demands are met. The tone of unity and camaraderie dissolves as the internal power struggles and military crackdowns begin. A large amount of time is spent accompanying the subjects as they move through the city streets, drawn back again and again, all roads leading to Tahrir. By the time a tenuous new normal emerges, characterized by the juxtaposition of the chaotic and the contemplative, it becomes clear that Tahrir Square is a place where the people will continue to return to negotiate their place in the new order of things.  I loved that you ended the film with images of Tahrir on a night in 2013, astoundingly crowded once again following the ousting of Mohammed Morsi. This is how the world first saw the Square, and rather than having it symbolize a one-off event that dominated the news cycle for a short while a couple of years ago, you remind us that there is no book-ending to be had here, and that all we have actually seen is the beginning of the story.

This time I hope the critical acclaim sticks and you don’t make any dodgy films with Claire Danes. I didn’t love It’s All About Love, I don’t think many did. After it was critically panned you seemed to disappear into the Danish woodwork while Lars von Trier, your former Dogme collaborator, was storming Cannes. But perhaps this was for the better. While nearly two decades divide the films, The Celebration and The Hunt share similar subject matter: child abuse. In The Celebration,  Christian seeks to reveal the truth of his father’s abuse, while in The Hunt, Lucas seeks to prove his own innocence. Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) finds himself at the centre of a witch hunt when a child’s hurt feelings are misconstrued. Just when his lonely life seems to be taking a turn for the better it all comes tumbling down, as his tight-knit community turns against him. Lucas works at the local nursery, he’s been downsized since the local school closed down. At home it’s just him and his dog, Fanny. He and his estranged wife are battling over the custody of his child, Marcus, who he only gets to see on alternate weekends. But he’s still got his friends and their local hunt group. Life gets better though. His son is about to move in and he’s got a fresh love interest: his house is about to be full. But this abruptly changes when his best friend’s daughter appears to make allegations of sexual abuse. His promised bright new life is about to come crashing down. Mikkelsen gives an excellent performance as Lucas, but it’s the children who really sparkle. Annika Wedderkropp is stunning as Klara; a lonely, ignored child who mistakenly hurts the man she most cares about. Lasse Foglestrøm as Marcus, Lucas’ son, is terrific too, as he fights for his father’s reputation. When I sat down to watch this film I was prepared for horrific things. I diligently waited as the beautiful scenery was set: the lovely architecture, the Springer Spaniel, the idyllic countryside and the fast friendships. I steeled myself for extremely violent visions; that never came. The most endearing aspect of the film is the fact it doesn’t try to go for the obvious highs of hysteria; there is instead a slow and unnerving creep. There was violence. But it didn’t reach the heights or constancy that I imagine many film-makers would have indulged in. For that I thank you. I didn’t want to watch a film ripped from the salacious world of the tabloids.  Instead I was pleasantly surprised. You focused on the relationships and the heart of the matter: trust. An element the characters all previously took for granted, something which they shall never do again.  Klara’s allegations hurt even more because she is Theo’s daughter, Lucas’s life-long best friend. Theo finds himself caught between believing his oldest friend or his young daughter. While Lucas finds the whole community turned against him including his dearest friends, with only a few key supporters left behind. It becomes clear that what matters most isn’t that he is no longer trusted, but that he no longer knows who he can trust. After this more nuanced character portrayal I’m sure Claire Danes wouldn’t mind  a call, if she’s on hiatus from Homeland, I think you’d be in luck.

While prepping for this film, based on Philomena’s true story, you must have uncovered some fascinating information about Sister Hildegarde’s past.  Who was she, really?  On one hand, she may have reunited Irish mothers and children that were separated in the mid 1900s. On the other hand, she apparently destroyed evidence about backroom adoption dealings for wealthy overseas couples who could easily afford a young, healthy white child.  So like most humans, she was likely part saint and part sinner. Regardless, Philomena needed a juicy antagonist and that’s what you delivered.  See, Philomena Lee (Judi Dench) is depicted as someone as innocent as they come.  But after becoming pregnant from a brief fling, her world is turned upside down.  As an older woman fifty years later, Philomena continues to look back with regret and wonders, “what happened to my child?”.  Through a series of fortunate events, her daughter Jane (Anna Maxwell Martin) meets the journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan). He initially doesn’t want to take on the “human interest story” but finds selfish motivations to give Philomena a chance to look for her son, Anthony.  As they retrace her steps, Philomena remembers the tender moments and the trauma of being forced to give away her boy to the Sisters in the Convent (including, of course, Sister Hildegarde).  As I’m sure you know, young women didn’t have many choices when it came to having babies out of wedlock during that time.  No one thought an unwed mother would be suitable wife material for the marriage bed.  And, young women were to be punished for their transgressions.  Philomena’s story takes her to America and eventually back to the Convent.  There she comes to realize that the nuns had a chance to change her life, and didn’t.  That’s the real tragedy of this story.  And yet, despite everything, Philomena’s ability to forgive the suffering caused to her is powerful. Back at the Convent is also where we see your portrayal of Sister Hildegarde.  Your representation is about what I would imagine it to be in this situation, along with the ability to still spew venomous beliefs in Philomena’s face after all those years.  It’s in direct contrast to Sixsmith’s protective nature of Philomena.  But, as it turns out, after I did some reading, the real Sister Hildegarde died well before Philomena met Sixsmith.  So, for the quarrel between Philomena, Sixsmith and Sister Hildegarde, you and director Stephen Frears worked “off book” so to speak (not following the original source material, a book called The Lost Child of Philomena Lee).  Still, you brought a realistic quality to Sister Hildegarde as a woman who believed that women like Philomena were sinners of the highest order. I’m not sure that Philomena will win any major awards, but it’s an important story to be a part of nonetheless.  A story about how far we’ve come as women in a mere fifty years or so.  A bittersweet story of regret and forgiveness.  All those things we love about a “human interest story” that may have never seen the light of day if it weren’t for a series of fortunate meetings. Stay true to the character, always!

But mediocrity is only measurable against greatness. And you know a little something about greatness, don’t you, John? Your career has been defined, in large part, by the sort of unsurpassed historical successes that most performers can only dream of: founding member of the century’s greatest comedy sextet, and writer/creator of the century’s greatest sitcom. And now you’ve given us The Croods.  But, wait: I’m not using the term mediocre as a pejorative. Sure, mediocre is a synonym for undistinguished or unexceptional, but it’s easy to forget that distinction and exception are rare feats, and not always what art aspires to. Indeed, mediocrity has its advantages. While mediocrity might be a foreign concept to someone like you, it’s not new to contemporary animated family films. DreamWorks Animation, in particular. One of the reasons they’ve never been able to replicate Pixar’s critical and financial success is that they don’t seem to subscribe to auteur theory. Instead, they develop their projects the same way a toy company develops new products. In the case of The Croods, you were just one of five screenwriters (and who knows how many more punch-up artists) meddling with this script. By contrast, it only took two people – you and your first wife, Connie Booth – to write every single episode of Fawlty Towers. In this sense, DreamWorks Animation is a sort of mediocrity factory; of the twenty-seven films they’ve released since 1998, only one, How To Train Your Dragon, has found the sort of unanimous acclaim Pixar regularly enjoyed in its pre-sequel heyday. So, how did you end up mixed up with them? My understanding is that it began with an adaptation of Roald Dahl’s The Twits. And from there evolved into an idea for a caveman buddy-flick. Only Hollywood’s special brand of tinkering could have mutated that into what we get onscreen in The Croods: a generic generational drama about a parent who wants one thing and a child who wants another, complete with a foul-mouthed granny, a sarcastic pet lemur, and a strong-willed, stereotype-breaking female lead character who nonetheless goes weak-kneed over a handsome fella and squeals with delight over a pair of shoes. But I was talking about the advantages of mediocrity, wasn’t I? Mediocrity is the inoffensive middle-ground, a soothing white noise. It’s peaceful. It requires no effort. And it has the power to surprise; it’s the short grass in which tiny triumphs can hide. At the beginning of the otherwise middling flick is an exciting chase sequence; a family hunt that occurs with the breakneck physics of a roadrunner cartoon. There are some really breathtaking images, too: a starry sky that reminds you of the majesty of starry skies; a lush jungle that borrows liberally from the botanical imagination of Dr. Suess; an ocean of volcanic ash that ebbs and flows and makes terrific use of the widescreen aspect ratio. And, at the end, a reconciliation between father and daughter that, despite all the cloying humor and sermonizing and false tension that led up to it, might, in the moment, shake loose some dust from the rafters of the theater, which will drift down into your eyes and prompt them (against your will) to protect themselves with a discharge of saline that might (again, against your will) leak out onto your face, which will require you to very subtly (because you don’t want to disturb your companions’ enjoyment of the film) lift your hand to your eye and stealthily rub away the wetness with the knuckle of your thumb, and, later, write a strongly-worded letter to the proprietors of the theater about the thoroughness of their janitorial upkeep. So you don’t necessarily have to feel ashamed to be associated with The Croods. You’ve given us enough greatness for two lifetimes, and there’s a place in the world for this sort of mediocre stuff. Just don’t get too comfortable down here.

No? No guesses? Let me give you a hint. See there’s a certain class of male Hollywood A-lister that decides he needs to have his very own dedicated make-up artist. Leonardo Dicaprio. Tom Cruise. Bradley Cooper. Brad Pitt. Despite not requiring any prostheses or aging effects (to look older, anyway), in 2013 these men refused to risk the acting trailer’s roulette make-up chair. Some of them have earned that luxury, I suppose. “Mr. Efron” has not. But the fact he still hired you for a performance that’s trying to make him seem like “just one of the guys” crystallizes everything that’s wrong with That Awkward Moment. Let me explain. For most men, imperfections are what endear to our onscreen heroes: Bill Murray’s pockmarks, Bruce Willis’ hairline, Christian Bale’s eye wart (warning: if you haven’t noticed that one yet, it henceforth can ever be unseen). This un-airbrushed reality acts like a subliminal reassurance that our boyish crushes are based purely on strength of character. We’re shallow and insecure creatures, after all, and wouldn’t want our affections to be mistaken for anything other than platonic. So in a movie about an extreme three-way bromance, these types of insights matter. We don’t have a friend like Zac Efron, and we don’t want a friend like Zac Efron. Miles Teller? Maybe. Michael B. Jordan? We should be so lucky. And no, I’m no longer talking about looks. It’s not fair to conflate characters and performers, but a romantic comedy like this isn’t asking anyone to “act” so much as “do your thing”. So Jason (Efron) is a witless womanizer and impossibly good looking. Daniel (Teller) is a wise-cracking wingman and professional sidekick. Mikey (Jordan) is accomplished, easy-going and earnest. They all dress extremely well, live in beautiful brick lofts and do their best to play a male Sex in the City trio. Then, upon Mikey’s wife leaving him, they make a bros-before-hoes pact that Efron’s character unreasonably treats like a holy covenant. Everything that happens next is an embarrassingly lazy one-conversation-would-clear-everything-up “drama”, spaced between some comedic set pieces. Including a toilet scene. The real reason you were hired, I presume. Which makes me think: maybe we men shouldn’t be so harsh on Efron. I mean, like DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street, Efron really “put himself out there” in this film, giving a “brave” ass-featuring fully nude profile shot (sans candle). I couldn’t look long, lest I compromise my fragile heterosexuality, but even at a glance this chiseled Adonis was glistening to perfection. Yes, despite the fact he was trying to hide a Viagra-induced erection in toilet. So what’s my beef, you ask? Only that instead of the moment being truly self-deprecating, funny and/or vulnerable, Efron turned the scene into what’s bound to be the most downloaded screensaver of the year. Unlike his High School Musical co-star and former fling Vanessa Hudgens, Efron’s just not ready go Spring Breakers on his perfect Disney persona yet.  And this is after getting urinated on by Nicole Kidman last year. No, I’m afraid there’s just no saving the boy. Or his movies.

You really did. But despite your best efforts, Labor Day isn’t the movie that Jason Reitman aspired to make. No, it’s something else. Sure, you brought a little style—but style, in this case, couldn’t overcome the substance. It rarely does when the substance is this ludicrous.  You know, there was a time way back in the golden age of cinema (the 1980s), when adult melodramas like this were prestige pictures (Rain Man, to which this flick owes an interesting musical debt, was the highest grossing movie of 1988). On paper, Labor Day aspires to that sort of mainstream appeal. Reitman has assembled all the vital pieces: a screenplay based on the novel by Joyce Maynard; a sprawling, eclectic cast that includes everyone from Oscar perennial Kate Winslet to People’s Choice Award occasional James Van Der Beek; a cinematographer, Eric Steelberg, whose floating camera is always panning and finding focus and framing things in interesting ways. And you, Rolfe: the award-winning composer who, in my opinion, wrote one of the great underappreciated scores of the last decade, Sideways.  You’ve been working with Jason for a long time – you scored his first film (Thank You For Smoking), his most acclaimed film (Up In The Air), and his best film (Young Adult) – but never before have you had to strain this hard to keep things together. Despite all that elaborate camerawork, despite all the capital-S smoldering that the actors do (particularly Josh Brolin, as the smoldering escaped convict whose full name, in the screenplay, was probably Frank Smolder), the story that it serves is such a syrupy-sweet, predictable domestic melodrama that, built with all this fine craftsmanship, it feels almost like a parody of itself. So you do your best to counteract it, Rolfe. You lay an ominous synthesizer drone beneath all these sun-drenched scenes of quaint small town life back in the halcyon days of 1987. When Brolin first meets Winslet and her young son at a department store and intimidates his way into the backseat of their car, you knit the entire sequence together with a throbbing, unceasing march that feels reminiscent of the way that Michael Penn and Jonny Greenwood have scored scenes in Paul Thomas Anderson films. You attempt to dilute the histrionics, to bring the mood of the film back down to earth with a few tricks of the trade. And you almost manage it. But the wheels and gears of the plot ultimately let you down. How can so much coincidence and happenstance and convenient circumstance be required to bring the characters to a climax that was obvious from the start?   One can’t help but think that with all the talent assembled to make this movie, something slightly more refined and substantial could have resulted.

Scahill takes you and your camera beyond the relative safety of being embedded with US troops: to remote Afghan villages, to Yemen, and into the encampments of Somali warlords. The story that is uncovered in those places – that of J-SOC, a shadowy military unit operating with little oversight, answerable only to the highest levels of the US government – must have also had you feeling a bit unsafe at home as well. Scahill traces J-SOC’s involvement in raids that left Afghan civilians dead and drone attacks in Yemen. Sadly, such revelations are no longer shocking. But they’re still damning. You and Scahill do a good job of making the story engaging – even thrilling, at times. You take us into the action. We’re right there in the backseat of the car when Scahill and his various guides drive through dangerous territory to meet with the people who have been affected by these secret military operations. It makes the film come alive in the way that talking heads can’t. Your direction created a narrative rather than an accumulation of facts (though it might have been nice if you’d labeled the scenes that were recreations, even though understandably, you didn’t want to break up the momentum you’d built). Recreations notwithstanding, I did like many of your stylistic choices: the drained and muted colour; the darkened edges of your frame. It makes for a striking contrast when you include footage from White House press conferences and American news shows, which are as bright and artificial as scenes from amusement parks. I understand that it’s necessary for Scahill to lead the audience through the story. This is a journalistic documentary, after all, and we need him to connect the dots and explain the complications. But the problem is that the film ultimately seems to make Scahill the focus. There are countless shots of him pinning documents to wall, or writing in hip-looking Brooklyn bars, or simply sitting and thinking. In his narration, the word “I” is used a lot. A lot. It’s almost as though you were both afraid that without the fearless, rakish reporter at its center, we weren’t going to connect with the story. I don’t think that would have been the case.  The story is important and Scahill has done tremendous work on it. But you both need to get out of the way.

The first choice? To star in the production, as well as direct it (though you’re probably getting the hang of it after directing yourself in last year’s Coriolanus). I can see why you wanted the role: Charles Dickens is a complex character, and your portrayal of him allows you to explore his highly dualistic nature.  The second choice is your focus on restraint. The premise of a young, working woman being kept as a mistress by an older distinguished man, although interesting, wouldn’t be half as tense without such space between the two. The affair between the young woman, Nelly, and Dickens feels chaste, yet it’s filled with tension because Nelly isn’t invisible at all—the least of all to Dickens. And that’s the beauty of their relationship. It’s dangerous. Dickens sees her so often – as do his wife and friends – that his intentions become blatantly obvious to everyone around him. Dickens thinks he can keep Nelly hidden in plain sight, but even by that era’s standards of propriety it’s an impossible feat.  It doesn’t help the situation when Dickens turns around and basically ditches his wife by writing an open letter about the breakdown of his marriage. Ouch. Any woman would feel a little sore. But he’s Charles Dickens. He has a flair for the dramatic. And the way that you portray him makes it clear that he’s less interested in recapturing his youth than he is in simply being adored by an intelligent, beautiful, vibrant woman. The daily grind of marriage with a woman who’s birthed ten of your children, and, as portrayed in your film, not so wise in the way of words—well, I can’t imagine it would have been all that stimulating for a man of such virility. As the film unfolds, The Invisible Woman moves at a steady pace between Nelly’s memory of her life after meeting Dickens and the present reality of her new life with husband and child. Your inclination as a director is to alternate big sweeping expanses with subtle emotional details. But it’s when you let those emotional details recede into the fabric of the frame that the film becomes truly breathtaking. Nelly is free and restrained at the same time, and it’s her determination to break free that keeps the story moving and alive in the present. The way the handheld camera is unsettled around Dickens mimics his manic energy. Blurring the background seems to be an intentional choice, conjuring the mood of Impressionist painters like Monet, Renoir, and Degas. I don’t know many movies in which such a choice stands out so prominently—or works so well.  It feels chaotic at first, but once the restraint of the relationship takes hold, the tone is appropriate, somehow loose and tightly-held at the same time.  There is a definite duality at play here. Both in the way the film is directed and in your acting choices: goodness and cruelty, light and dark, freedom and restraint.

Fleetwood Mac. The Police. Oasis. Their tumultuous off-stage relationships not only fueled media interest, though – they also fanned their artistic flames.  Most groups, however, will simply fizzle away or completely implode when relationships become strained. The titular band in The Broken Circle Breakdown is certainly in that latter company, though their core dilemma in the film is more unbearable than most. Their foreshadowed collapse, were it not fictional, would also rank among the greatest hits of musical meltdowns. But let’s start when things are at their best for the Broken Circle Breakdown – on stage. Using non-linear editing, we open on a performance of this Belgian bluegrass band in a sweaty, underground club. They look and sound perfectly American, but the twang in their harmonized accents is just part of the show. Lead singer Didier (Johan Heldenbergh) in particular, is completely infatuated with U.S. culture, even living on a farm that could pass for rural Alabama. He’s building a home with the band’s co-lead singer Elise (Veerle Baetens) and their cancer-ridden young daughter. As the story slides back-and-forth like the playing of a steel guitar, one moment we’re with them at their daughter’s side in the hospital, and the next we’re witnessing her conception in the back of a pick-up truck. Unlike the irrepressible pace of their music, the story off-stage is more reflective and interested in silences. Elise and Didier start to question life’s injustices and adopt very different philosophies to cope with their pain. In private, they manage to be mostly civilized in their discussions. But on stage, their schism starts to take root and become apparent. Until, of course, it becomes undeniable – and painfully uncomfortable. Luckily, as an audience we often get to return to those beautiful musical interludes. And it’s your simple stage direction that helps us decode exactly where we are in their timeline – whether they are joyously sharing a mic at an intimate venue, or awkwardly spaced out across a grand stage in matching – but soulless – white outfits. These physical manifestations of their evolving careers and relationship also hint to some of the film’s larger existential questions. From the earthy tones of their early wardrobe, reflecting their roots in the underground music scene, to their unlikely and unexplained heavenly rise to stardom (or at least, a sold-out amphitheatre) in tailored white suits. We aren’t given details about how it happened, much like the characters themselves aren’t given answers to why events happened in their own lives, but I was pleased to see where they ended up.

Particularly because LEGO itself — the bricks and plates, the classic minifigures—would seem to be a dream tool for creating an old-fashioned stop motion movie.  But I totally understand that modern production costs must have dictated that such a quaint approach was too time-consuming and (more importantly) too costly for what might be considered a two-hour toy commercial. But when you designed the sets for the movie, you clearly did so in consideration of the real-world limitations the actual LEGO bricks would have imposed. The  buildings, rooms, the double-decker couches, Abraham Lincoln’s flying chair—they’re all built with the same absurd creativity that an 8-year old in the basement brings to playing with LEGO. And, thanks to you, every frame of The LEGO Movie is infused with that sense of joy. That came as a relief to me. I wouldn’t say that I was dreading The LEGO Movie, exactly. Its pedigree is solid: directors and co-writers Christopher Miller and Phil Lord were responsible for the kid-favourite Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs (the first one, not the terrible second one) as well as the not-at-all-kid-friendly 21 Jump Street (another movie that was far better than expected). And the voice talent – which includes Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Will Ferrel, Nick Offerman, Charlie Day, and Morgan Freeman to name a very few – is top-notch. Still, LEGO is a product with such a large and rabid following that everyone involved could have been forgiven for treating the actual movie as an afterthought (you know, as long as it met its financial expectations). But almost everything in The LEGO Movie works fabulously: it’s funny when it wants to be, with crack comic timing; the action scenes are genuinely exciting, devoid of the frantic editing or long shots typical of CGI-heavy films; it’s even touching in ways one doesn’t quite expect. And like any LEGO creation worth its salt, The LEGO Movie is assembled from the bits and pieces of other movies. The building blocks come from The Matrix, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and even Metropolis.  Emmet (Pratt) is a construction worker in Bricksburg, happy to live life by the rules and play the part in society he’s ben assigned. He spends his days going to work, listing to the same song as everyone else (“Everything is Awesome!!!”) and watching the most popular sitcom (“Where are My Pants?”). Life in Bricksburg even comes with its own instruction manual, which tells citizens how best to fit in. After being left behind at work one night, Emmet meets Wyldstyle, a Trinity-like freedom fighter (but better motorcycle-driver) who has her sights set on deposing the oppressive President Business, who admonishes his citizens to “stop messing with my stuff.” Leading the President’s forces is Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson)—because when you’re made out of LEGO, you can be both.  Wyldstyle believes Emmet him to be The Special, the chosen one who will lead the revolution and free the masses. How this relatively straightforward plot comes to involve a blind wizard, a classic 80s LEGO spaceman, a cyborg pirate, a magical cat with anger management issues, Batman, and even Lando Calrissian is a lot of the fun. It sounds convoluted, and it kind of is, but I don’t mind convolution when it involves Batman’s attempt at songwriting (sample lyrics: “Dark-ness/No parents”). Besides, the way a story unfolds on the fly feels a lot like a child rifling through a box of random LEGO pieces and rationalizing how each new find should fit into the story’s world. That world (worlds, actually, since Emmet passes through at least five of them) is fantastic, though I can’t help admitting to a certain amount of jealousy that you were given the opportunity to work on it. It sounds like a dream come true: you spent your days designing and constructing fantastic new worlds brick-by- virtual brick. You actually got paid to play LEGO—and you didn’t even have to clean up the mess afterward. Bricksburg, the Old West, New Zealand, and, yes, Cloud Cuckoo Land are all sets kids will be asking for as the credits roll. The main message of the film is to let go of the instruction manual and let your imagination guide the way, and the fact that this message will most likely be used to sell products with instruction manuals that will allow kids to faithfully recreate the supposedly ad-hoc creations in the movie is a bit ironic. But The LEGO Movie has enough energy and wit to push these distractions aside (maybe a little too much energy; as the film moves towards the climax, it could have taken a little more time to better develop some late revelations). But these are minor quibbles, the two or three blue bricks in an otherwise yellow castle wall. The execution may not be perfect, but that structure will stand strong.

The only other two words likely to get the core demographic this excited might be ‘Free Uggs’. You could have written this script on a cocktail napkin, drunk, and it still would have put Lulu Lemon-clad butts in the seats. Unfortunately, you did something even worse. You actually tried to write a vampire movie that didn’t suck—and you failed. It’s even more disappointing given the film’s pedigree, which I stupidly allowed to get my hopes up. Sadder still is that this movie will probably gross more than ten times the GDP of Burundi, which might lead you to confuse popularity with quality. The director – your brother Mark – has helmed two of the better teen-targeted films of the 2000s. Freaky Friday and Mean Girls were both notable for transcending their target demo. Maybe if you hadn’t written one of the sharpest, funniest, darkest teen films of all time, I wouldn’t have anticipated that you and your brother might once again achieve teen movie nirvana. Could it be that your inspirational well was already sucked dry by writing such dark-souled vampiric female characters in Heathers? Your next script, Hudson Hawk, failed spectacularly and later became a cult classic (but at least has the self-respect to be popular ironically). Your convoluted plot is explained as breathlessly as a fifteen year-old girl might describe a spat at the spring formal; there are good guys and bad guys and bad good guys and good bad guys. Rose Hathaway is a 17-year-old half-human/half-vampire Dhampir, training to be a guardian to her best friend, Lissa, who is a peaceful, mortal vampire of royal blood who must be protected from the Strigoi (aka. the undead, immortal vampires). It’s all rather exhausting, and none of it really matters unless you care about the players, which is impossible since you’ve drawn them so palely. As I watched Rose valiantly attempt to spit out your Aaron Sorkin-lite rapid-fire dialogue, I was reminded of that other firecracker of a teen heroine, Veronica Mars, a wise beyond her years go-getter. But unlike Veronica, Rose isn’t given lines with any crackle or nuance, and spends her time either delivering or receiving exposition. She does much of this in a too-tight sports bra while her trainer/love interest, Dmitri (Danila Kozlovsky), struggles to provide vital plot information in his thick Russian accent. This Baltic Taylor Kitsch is physically perfect for the role, but way out of his depth. Couldn’t you have gone easier on the poor hunk during the on-set rewrites? Or gone easier on us? Subtitles maybe? You and Mark seem to be playing mad scientist in an effort to make both tweens and their Moms feel equal in a look-honey-we-can-fit-into-each-other’s-clothes kind of way: an 80s pop-culture reference here, a slick CGI sequence there. The gothic sets and oxblood colour palette are ripped straight from a Heart video. The frenetic pacing, more appropriate, perhaps, for a first-person video game, had me craving a Ritalin Latte. It’s a shame that what scant, witty dialogue you supplied gets lost within Richelle Mead’s labyrinthine source material.  There are some laughs here, if you’re willing to flag them down. Most are delivered by the film’s lead (and lone bright spot), Zoey Deutch, who I rooted for mainly because she just seemed so damned exhausted trying to stay one step ahead of your script’s forced cleverness. She‘s the perfect hybrid for this film: a whip-smart, too-cool-for-school anti-hero played by the daughter of  Howard Deutch, the man who directed the 80’s teen classics Pretty in Pink and Some Kind Of Wonderful. It was on the set of the latter film that he met Zoey’s mother, Lea Thompson, herself the female lead in an epic trilogy (Back To The Future). Zoey has an ass-kickin’ Ellen Page-vibe, and I hope this film acts as a launching pad for her the same way Heathers worked for Winona Ryder (though, for Zoey’s sake, I hope that’s where the similarities between their careers end). I get the feeling you wanted Vampire Academy to be the vampire movie for the cool kids and the cool parents. To be the Un-Twilight. You’re pretty explicit about it, in fact: voice-over assures us early on that the vampires in this world “don’t sparkle”. But they don’t exactly shine either. You and I both know this film will make a mint regardless of whether it’s good or not, and maybe you’re okay with that. But I have a feeling that the guy known for creating clever films for those on the fringe might not feel comfortable knowing he’s made a middling blockbuster for everybody.

At least, I think you did your part. After all, it’s hard to tell if The Monuments Men was cast by you, or if it was a case of director, co-producer, and co-writer George Clooney simply choosing which buddies he wanted to hang out with for a few months. That may sound cynical, but I don’t mean it as a negative—the company he chooses to keep is full of actors I’m more than willing to spend a couple hours with. It’s just that, after all is said and done, his choice of good-time pals was the most amount of thought he put into the film. It’s not fun for me to think like this. I really wanted to like The Monuments Men. After more than a decade of verité-obsessed World War II films that took their mark (and stole their style) from Saving Private Ryan, The Monuments Men’s retro style is pretty refreshing. And when Alexander Desplat’s score kicked the film off with a march reminiscent of Elmer Bernstein’s music for The Great Escape, I felt like I was returning to those simpler times when a war picture could be a grand adventure and not a test of my humanity. Sure, we might lose a few men along the way, but in the end it will all have been for a greater good. And that’s what really counts, right? Heading up this escapade is Clooney’s character, Frank Stokes, who assembles a team of historians and artists to track down priceless works of art stolen by the Nazis, save them from destruction, and return them to their rightful owners. Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, and Jean Dujardin all play members of the titular team. Like I said, those are all likeable actors, and each of them brings an easy-going charm to their roles. Cate Blanchett is solid, too, as a museum worker and French resistance fighter dedicated to keeping track of the stolen pieces that pass through her museum.  Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov worked from the book by Robert M. Edsel and Ben Witter,  and certainly want to structure The Monuments Men as a thrilling ride through war-torn Europe. They go out of their way to give Stokes a personal motivation for saving at least one specific piece of art, and then, on top of that, create two separate races against time: one involving Hitler’s order to destroy all stolen art before the allies can reclaim it, another involving the Russian Army claiming all found art as a restitution for their terrible losses. But these elements are introduced, forgotten, and then reintroduced only when the film needs to remind itself that something is supposed to be at stake. And with the exception of Blanchett, everyone member of the Monuments Men is so relaxed, so seemingly unaffected by their predicament, the threat never feels real. The cumulative effect of so much charm is that whenever events take turn for the serious, it feels too casual to be dramatic. It’s too bad, because Murray, playing architect Richard Campbell, has an especially nice scene involving a recorded Christmas message from his daughter. If only there was a better-constructed film around it to help it ring truer. I wonder what it’s like for someone in your position to see a finished film like The Monuments Men. On paper, it should work. I wanted it to work. It’s hard to find so much fault with a film that means so well. You did what George asked of you—it’s just too bad George didn’t live up to his part of the bargain.

Really? You’re going with black? This was my first reaction. Even as a first-class spoilerphobe, I couldn’t avoid seeing leaked set photos of the new Robocop suit and catching glimpses of all the publicity materials. Good thing, actually. It gave me time to adjust, to breathe, to recalibrate my expectations. At one point, I even got my hopes up; having Elite Squad director José Padilha got me thinking this remake might be more than just a needless update. But I now realize that was probably asking too much. At least, to my pleasant surprise, the first iteration of Robocop’s suit perfectly appeased my desire to see robots that actually look like shiny-metal robots. Your more tactical specialty suit is introduced rather quickly though, lest we get too nostalgic. But here’s the thing: I actually managed to embrace the new suit.  So that’s something. In fact, there was a lot that I kind of dug about this film. The man inside your suit, for one. I’ve had an unhealthy man-crush on Swedish actor Joel Kinnaman since his turn as the low-key, street-wise detective Stephen Holder on The Killing. He’s not asked to stretch his acting muscles here (or any muscles, really), but he’s exactly the right man to root for inside the machine—just like the film’s tech-hawking villain played by Michael Keaton wants. Apparently, in the not-nearly-distant-enough future of 2028, the U.S. is the “only country in the world” that hasn’t legalized un-manned killing machines for local law enforcement. So Keaton looks for a loophole by melding machinery with a near-dead undercover Detroit police officer, Alex Murphy. But this debate over the use of drone technology is pretty much where the social commentary begins and ends. The brainy ultra-violence of the original is also missing in this PG-13 affair. The only remaining satirical elements come from Samuel L. Jackson’s right-wing TV personality (though his primary purpose is to dump exposition on us). He introduces the world by showing us a bot-heavy scene from Tehran (the rusty-but-once-shiny-metal kind), which looks great and seems to be setting up a larger story, but turns out to be little more than a technology teaser for the third act of the film and brief chance to get us out of Motown. After that, cue the electro score and familiar futuristic font. In a serve-and-protect blue rather than white and red. But nothing as boring as, say, pure black. Oh, sorry.  Don’t feel bad, John.  After a middling TV series and the diminishing returns of the original franchise, I’m more convinced than ever that the Robocop mythology should get darker. Maybe even his suit, too. Maybe.

For that film, which only had its visuals going for it, the hilariously bad old man makeup only underlined how bad everything else is. Well, you dodged a bullet by choosing the more modest epic that is Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa. But you must have wondered—as you lovingly crafted the convincingly elastic old man ballsack and delicate face wrinkles—that despite being a better movie, it was also undeserving of the Oscar nomination that was bestowed upon it. That sad sack and wrinkles belong primarily to Irving Zisman (Johnny Knoxville), the titular Bad Grandpa. Rediscovering debauchery after his wife passes, he then reluctantly leaves to deliver his young grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) across several states to live with the boy’s loser father. It’s the thinnest of storylines, but it takes you through a funeral, estate sale, to the bingo hall, a strip club and other perfect settings for Jackass pranks. And the pranks, in true Jackass style, make you laugh. Out of shock, disbelief, joy, and all of the other reasons. For a few seconds. There is almost nothing lasting about the laughs or surprises, and the story definitely doesn’t sit with you once the movie is done. And most would argue that it isn’t trying to. That under the disguise of higher production values and a narrative approach with a script and characters, that it’s still just a Jackass movie. So why the disguise? Some of the best parts of the Jackass movies is the fact that real people were doing totally unreal things. The friendships and bromances that lead to visceral injuries is the magic. Doing the same, but in disguises while pranking complete strangers is the least important part of the whole endeavour.  Because in the disguise, I get pranked too. Is there something special in the relationship between the young boy and his very bad grandpa? Are there themes of ageism and changing expectation in our aging population? If you believe the disguise, you might engage the movie that way. And then feel like a total jerk because it’s not an actual narrative movie! It’s just a Jackass prank. You fooled me for expecting more. It was all just a costumer for an actual movie. Still, it’s enjoyable. There’s enough going on that your time watching it isn’t wasted (unlink Prometheus, which was a technology demo disguised as a movie). But when you put together the disguise, and use it to mislead, you better know who’s laughing and who’s played. If you’re expecting the wrong people to pay for their investment, you might not get more than the one try.

You were remembered as the man who started A&M’s movie division in the early 80s and produced the beloved film The Breakfast Club. You were one of the founding partners of ESPN’s Classic Sports channel. You were known and remembered by titans in the music industry, including Sting, Herb Alpert, and Joe Cocker.  And yet most people have never heard of you.  The same can be said of the women featured in your final produced film, which shines a spotlight on the (ironically) unsung heroes of the music industry: session vocalists, or as they are more universally known, backup singers. When you hear the voices of Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer, Tata Vega and others, you can’t help but wonder why they aren’t massive stars. Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, and Mick Jagger are just a few of the rock gods interviewed in the doc, and they seem just as confused as I was by the lack of notoriety given to these incredible singers. Indeed, it’s impossible not to have respect for the women responsible for some of the catchiest vocal hooks in pop music history. Like you, Gil, these women seem to be renowned only by industry insiders. I wonder: was it this kinship that drew you to the project? It takes a certain type of ego to give up the relative safety of toiling in anonymity to pursue super-stardom. Many singers interviewed maintain that singing backup is far less stressful and therefore more rewarding. Yet nearly every one of them has released a solo album to little or no fanfare. Lisa Fischer won a Grammy in 1991 for an R&B hit…and never charted again. We see her standing in line at the post office amongst people who have no idea that she has sung backup on every Stones tour since 1989. Darlene Love – probably the best known of the unknowns (an honour akin to being valedictorian of summer school) – is widely regarded for being the prototype for every backup singer that followed. She signed a devil’s contract with Phil Spector that kept her under his thumb, and by the mid-70s she was cleaning houses to pay her bills. It’s criminal that she might be best known for playing Danny Glover’s wife in the Lethal Weapon franchise. Merry Clayton, another unsung backup, recalls that she was pregnant and in curlers when she got a call to come down to the studio at two in the morning to belt out the iconic line “Rape, murder/It’s just a shot away” in the chorus of “Gimme Shelter.” No one owes her pipes a debt of gratitude more than Martin Scorsese. 20 Feet has fingers in a lot of narrative pies, but it’s most interesting when it focuses on the singers’ struggles in a historical context. Most are black daughters of preachers, which would explain the call-and-response nature of their early gigs with legends like Ray Charles and Ike & Tina Turner. As the British rockers who built their sound around American blues gained popularity in the 70s, they turned to these same black female singers to give their records the Delta soul sound they craved. More than one performer noted that it was this cultural appropriation that gave them the most freedom as vocalists. This era would be the apex for most backup careers.  You were known as a nurturer of singers and songwriters at A&M. You allowed artists to mature. If only you had lived long enough to do the same with 20 Feet From Stardom. Instead of focusing on two of the more resonant storylines – those of Darlene and Lisa – the film overextends itself by laying down too many over-produced backing vocals. Had you lived to guide this project to fruition, it might have finally put you on the map.  20 Feet From Stardom aims for the heart, hoping, it seems, to duplicate the success of last year’s Oscar winner Searching For Sugarman, another doc that profiles a singer who shoulda- coulda-woulda been a huge star. Unfortunately, the aim is off here. Where Searching takes the audience on a magical mystery tour, 20 Feet languishes behind the music. Sure, it has a great beat, and you can dance to it, but it’s more of a one-hit wonder than a timeless classic.

The unfortunate effect of such an approach is that every endless scene of Endless Love looks like it’s taking place in the pages of a catalogue. Though I suppose the strategy works since the rest of film rings just as false. For a modern adaptation of a 1970s best-seller, it’s odd that the modernization process seems to have stalled somewhere in the 1990s — the mid-90s to be precise. And who are our American Eagle Outfitters models? There’s Alex Pettyfer as David, an 18-going-on-32 high-schooler not quite able to conceal his British accent. He has long fostered a crush on Gabriella Wilde’s Jade Butterfield, even though she’s only known to her classmates as a wealthy recluse; her family has closed in on itself since the death of its eldest son.  After what passes in this catalogue world for a meet-cute (Jade drops a book), David pursues Jade. Of course this causes tentions with her controlling father, Bruce Greenwood, who manages to give his stock character moral shadings that aren’t present in the sets or the script. Naturally, David comes from a working-class family (we know this because his father owns a garage — the cleanest, best-arranged garage ever), but the film goes out of its way to make sure we know that he’s not that working-class (his SAT scores are above 2900, which, as a Canadian, I can only assume is impressive). This, as well as his affinity for setting each rendez-vous in a libraries or bookstore (actual line: “I forgot how much I love to read!”), lets us know it’s okay to root for him. Jade dose succumb to David’s charms, mostly because he salvages a botched party at her stately manor (J. Crew, Spring Collection 1996). It’s a party that involves a competition in which a bunch of cool teenagers dance to such current mainstream hits as Salt-n-Pepa’s “Push It”.  (I mentioned that this movie supposedly takes place in 2014, right?) Anyway, with the relationship heating up and Jade questioning the future planned out by her father, Papa Butterfield takes the family to their lake house (Restoration Hardware, Summer Nights 1994). When David arrives, tensions rise, secrets are revealed, and plot devices that manage to be both predictable and lazily executed occur—including the most conveniently-timed car accident one could possibly hope for. Will these two crazy lovers make it? Will obsessive parents and ex-girlfriends succeed in driving them apart? Will David spend his days working in his father’s garage (Fossil Vintage Wear 1995)? Endless Love works its way through all these questions with all the boldness and panache of painting a room taupe: sure, it’s tasteful and makes everything work, but it’s bland and safe and boring as hell.  Casey Status: Return to Sender (2/5)"},{"title":"Cutie and the Boxer","url":"/2014/02/18/cutie-and-the-boxer","date":"2014-02-18 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Noriko Shinohara, Artist, You’re a brave woman, being an artist married to another artist for so long. Your husband, Ushio – who we come to know as Bullie in the animated “art brought to life” segments of the documentary Cutie and The Boxer – seems like he’s been a bit of a handful the past thirty-nine years or so. I think you’re aware that maybe you should have found someone a little more responsible than a temperamental avant-garde artist, and now recovered alcoholic, as your life partner. But I have to commend you. Many people would not have put up with his ways for so long—especially considering his attitude towards artistic relationships that dictates “the average one has to support the genius.” When you showed up, he knew he needed someone like you to keep him afloat. That’s why he asked you to stay. That’s why you’ve stayed. And that’s why you fell in love with him. Wait. Maybe he is a genius.  Most artists are. Or at least that’s how they’re perceived in the real world. You can see it in the way you’re both treated by gallery owners and art buyers. They want to be a part of your magic and to put it on display. Artistry needs an entourage, after all. People to do their bidding, pay the bills, do the paperwork and shit jobs, love them and their messiness, all so the artist can submerge themselves in their work.  It’s all part of the charm.  As the documentary unfolds, however, I sense that you’ve grown wiser. You’ve become a woman who stands beside Ushio rather than behind him; a woman who challenges him, and one who makes her own voice heard. You say it yourself: “Cutie is very good at taming Bullie.” You push him because you know he’s worth it. But you’re also realistic. You know Ushio will only make an effort when it’s absolutely required.  And when he does make an effort, in domestic matters, his approach is like his art—fast and furious. Then you critique him, he takes it in, and he bides his time before being domestic again. That’s the process of your relationship. There is a sweetness to your life too. Most marriages don’t last forty years. It takes your endurance, you point out, to make this life work. There’s a competitive edge between the two of you, but with Ushio’s advanced age, he seems to be mellowing, at least when it comes to sharing the spotlight with you. And your art, which has evolved over the years of your marriage, is a reflection of the life the two of you built together. And his life has also been forever altered by having you in it with him. He knows that, even though he doesn’t always feel the need to tell you. If the distance between the opening and closing credits is any indication, it took you a long time to move from being an assistant and witness to Ushio’s life to claim an active role, as someone willing to throw your own punches. All those years of struggle could not have been easy, and you admit the only reason you’d do it all over again is for your art. It’s always easier to look back and justify your actions once the dust has settled, but I understand what you mean. You wouldn’t be where you are, and your art exhibit Cutie and The Bullie wouldn’t exist, without the years of unpaid bills, the leaky roof, and the dirty diapers behind you. You’ve survived it all and lived to make art about it because like you say, “Love is a roar.” I’m not sure where your journey will end, but I’m sure that your art will continue to evolve and change as the years go by. The impetus may come from a different place once Ushio is gone, and you may find you have to rethink your words: “But it won’t be true if it has a happy ending.” I, for one, would be interested to find out. Thank you for having such an open life, and for allowing me to have a glimpse of it.

The differing societies presented in the film is one of its primary delights. We get a sense of two communities that have more similarities than they might think: the aboveground world populated by bears is similar to small European villages and the mice live in carefully constructed burrows. However, in both societies, there is a true sense of history. It makes sense that I cite your production design, since Ernest & Celestine is about two individuals who would fade into the background if it weren’t for their amazing artistic skills. Celestine the Mouse loves to draw, while Ernest the Bear is a classically trained pianist. They are completely at odds with the demands their societies lay down on them: the mouse world is obsessed with collecting bear teeth and Ernest comes from a long line of judges. When they meet, there is an instant kinship between them. The film indulges in the sweetness between them, when both are on the run for committing acts seen as counterproductive in their respective worlds. The hand-painted backgrounds have a delicate touch to them, with a softness that suggests the feeling of flipping through a picture book. Your designs compliment the character animation wonderfully. They feel integral and even add a bit of quiet humour, including a great scene in which Celestine tries to sleep while Ernest plays his piano upstairs. Whether you watch it in French or in the English dub, the jokes aren’t lost in translation and that’s in large part because of the deftness of your artwork. Though the concept of mouse tooth fairies is a very European one, directors Stephane Aubier, Vincent Patar and Benjamin Renner, along with screenwriter Daniel Pennac make it feel universal. The mood of Ernest & Celestine, and why it manages to work so well, is its sheer adorableness. The way the two characters bond is sweet, reminiscent of a father-daughter relationship. The intelligence of the screenplay also shines through with its messages on prejudice. The bears, it turns out, are just as afraid of the mice, but the movie never gives a real reasoning behind this (as prejudice works much the same way). The film even makes a sly connection between the ruthless mouse dentist and the bear who cunningly ruins his clientele’s teeth with sweets so they’ll to his wife’s dental shop. All of this plays into the subtle sense of humour that runs through the entire picture. Computer animation continues to evolve and grow as the talented artists at Disney and Blue Sky succeed in creating and taking us to magical worlds. You’ve proven with this film that the art of hand-drawn animation is still very much alive. Ernest & Celestine possesses a quiet innocence and that storybook quality owes a lot to the production design. Altogether, this is a very touching, enriching story. From an old and new school animation fan, Stefan Status: Air Mail (3.5/5)"},{"title":"Takedown: The DNA of GSP","url":"/2014/02/21/takedown-the-dna-of-gsp","date":"2014-02-21 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Koo Atswali, Rights Clearance, You, of all people, will understand why I might go in to a film like Takedown: The DNA of GSP  with a bit of skepticism.  The UFC is fiercely protective of their macho image, so a documentary about one of their biggest stars is bound to be about as revealing as a Justin Bieber concert film. In order to show the biggest fights of George St. Pierre’s career, and the intense training that preceded them, the UFC’s full cooperation must have been a pre-requisite. Which means this film is less a documentary than it is branded content, designed to sell the sport, and no better than the The Ultimate Fighter reality series—or anything else on Spike TV.   So I should congratulate you in a job well done. Because I’m sold. On your film, anyway. Not so much mixed martial arts. It’s a brutal way to make a living, after all.  St. Pierre himself puts it nicely during an archival interview when he says he’s fighting for legitimacy as an athlete because, unlike hockey or football, “you can’t say I’m gonna play MMA. It’s not a game.” And it’s those stakes that helped me invest in St. Pierre as a protagonist (his being Canadian doesn’t hurt, either). More interestingly, unlike most action heroes, he’s not invincible (GSP’s DNA is often leaking out all over his face). He’s not even undefeated. In fact, his own trainer admits that St. Pierre’s not the best at any particular fighting style. It’s his work ethic and ability to actually mix the martial arts that makes him so dangerous.  That, and his ability to channel OCD into a rigorous training routine. A few fresh techniques used by co-directors Kristian Manchester and Peter Svatek also helped win me over. The constant cross-cutting to footage of a wolf stalking through the snow was a rather blunt metaphor, but the black and white re-enactments of St. Pierre’s youth, staged through photography, felt special. Sure, it may romanticize his struggles with being bullied, but it felt balanced by a sobering press conference with his fiercest rival, Nick Diaz.  This rivalry is what fuels the second half of the film, with scrappy inner-city Diaz being the perfect foil for St. Pierre’s disciplined, gentlemanly persona. The film’s final confrontation ends up referencing those sequences of St. Pierre’s youth. The fight is featured in black and white super-slow-motion shots with no commentary. It’s also slightly out of sequence. This new way of looking at the fight will probably help fans of the sport see the tactics and strategy with fresh eyes, and kept me from feeling like I was simply sold tickets to a Sportscentre highlight reel. Or maybe it was treated that way because you weren’t able to acquire the rights.  But don’t tell me. I don’t want it to tarnish the film’s precious image.

It’s been a few years since we’ve seen you on the big screen. 1997  wasn’t it? Dante’s Peak? I understand that devoting yourself to family – and your various charity projects – left you precious little time to pursue your acting career (kudos for turning down SyFy’s script for Volc-nado, by the way; it was beneath you). You’re smart, you played the waiting game, and it certainly worked in your favour. There have been a lot of technological advances since your last film work, and now, thanks to 3D, you are without a doubt the superstar of Pompeii. Since it took you so long to come out of your trailer, they had to start the movie without you. Here’s what you missed: Milo (Kit Harrington), is the last of the Celtic Horse tribe. As a child he watched his people die brutally at the hands of the Romans, led by Senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland). Now a slave and omnipotent gladiator, Milo is brought to Pompeii to fight. The beautiful and wealthy Cassia (Emily Browning) has returned to her family in Pompeii after an extended stay in Rome. Her father Severus (Jared Harris), in an attempt to secure city expansion funds from the Emperor, promises Cassia’s hand in marriage to the brutal Corvus. Cassia and Milo have fallen for one another and Milo vows revenge against Corvus… …but none of this is of any consequence since (spoiler alert!) everyone is going to die. As the film begins, the camera pans slowly over what appear to be statues, but which turn our to be the petrified remains of the citizens of Pompeii. These are the most multi-dimensional people we see on screen. Until you arrive, of course. Maybe the writers were trying to spare us the pain of rooting for fully-fleshed out characters when they were destined to be blasted into ash by you. This was your first time working with action-porn director Paul W.S. Anderson (of the Resident Evil franchise), so you had to know he was going to make you work harder than you’ve ever worked before. It even looks like you put on a significant amount of weight in preparation for the role of Vesuvius. All your efforts paid off, because I, for one, couldn’t wait for you to show up and do your thing.  There are some well-choreographed yet utterly unconvincing fight scenes to watch while waiting for your arrival, and Kit Harrington’s abs are more than a little distracting, but it’s all just prolonging the inevitable.  First you rumble like an upset tummy. Then you roil, causing buildings to tremble and pillars to fall. The CGI specialists (would they be considered your hair, make-up, and costume team?) really outdid themselves, bringing out all your best features. When you belch black clouds of smoke into the sky, blocking out the sun, your background in method acting really shows. I truly believed you wanted to kill all those people, and I thought to myself: what took you so long? When you finally erupted, and spewed lava and fury through the defenseless port city, the screaming citizens of Pompeii knew they were outmatched—and I knew that I’d been rooting for the right hero all along. I hope we don’t have to wait so long to see you onscreen again. Your absence was truly felt. You would have been perfect in the Twilight series, or countless Nicholas Sparks adaptations, or pretty much every Adam Sandler movie since the turn of the century. You’re hot right now, but I’d understand if you wanted to take the ol’ one-for-the-studio/one-for-me approach when choosing your next project (I heard you were collaborating with the Duplass brothers on that mumblecore flick about Krakatoa). I hope you got points on Pompeii’s back end. You earned them.

You get to use common objects to recreate every nuance of sound that isn’t picked up on set. This must train your ears to be extra sensitive to the everyday sounds that go unnoticed by the average person.  How is it, then, that you didn’t hear the ticking noise when this bomb got dropped in your lap? I’m sure for a man of your talents, the script sounded pretty juicy: horse hoofs-stepping on cobblestone, clanging iron gates, rusty locks opening, a safe being cracked, a coal furnace on the verge of explosion, gunshots, punches. Lots for you to do here. In one of the first scenes, a coin is flipped in the air and makes a satisfying ping sound. Coincidentally, that was the exact same noise my disbelief made as it broke free from the tenuous wire upon which it had been suspended. It’s not your fault. If you gave a six-year-old a Skittles and Red Bull smoothie and asked him to tell you a love story about a magical white horse and a beautiful girl that lives in a tent on top of a mansion, he couldn’t possibly come up with anything as fantastical and rambling as Winter’s Tale. Perhaps you can help me out here. I think it goes something like this: an orphaned thief is pursued by the menacing gang leader who works for the Devil, and one night breaks into a mansion where he is thwarted by a squeaky floorboard that exposes his intentions to a wealthy young woman dying of consumption. They fall in love and flee to her family estate beside a frozen lake, where after one romantic night together, she dies and he becomes immortal. And then he appears as an amnesiac in modern day New York where he meets another girl…who also happens to be dying.  Or something like that. I’m not even sure. Maybe I should just ask the six-year-old. Lucifer, played by Will Smith (who appears to have mistakenly wandered in from one of his kid’s video shoots, which must explain why he’s wearing Hammer pants in 19th century New York), vainly attempts to lay out the larger theme for us: everyone has a miracle inside of them. In this world, some people can be reincarnated and those in heaven have the choice to come back and walk the earth as mortals. Now, I’m not religious, but I did find myself praying for this movie to redeem itself. Will the orphan with a heart-of-gold and the beautiful dead girl be reunited? Will Russell Crowe’s menacing Perley Soames and his henchmen get their comeuppance? Is Jennifer Connelly’s daughter going to live? Not once did I fear that bad things wouldn’t happen to the bad people and good things would happen to the good people. The tension in this film is so slack you could cut it with a dead trout. There’s a new foley sound for you! With it’s chilly, saturated jewel tones and sumptuous Edwardian sets, this film, on its surface, is stunning. The leads have genuine chemistry; Jessica Brown Findlay looks like a Botticelli painting and Colin Farrell’s face isn’t quite as punchable as usual (quite a feat considering he’s meant to be playing a 21-year-old). The action scenes are also well-shot, the CGI elements aren’t obtrusive, and your foley work compliments it all wonderfully. I don’t doubt that everyone brought their A-game to this film, but when the story is as tedious as this one, none of the details matter.  Sadly, there’s no sound effect loud enough to mask the sound of suck.   Hope to hear from you again, Di Status: Return to Sender (1.5/5)"},{"title":"3 Days to Kill","url":"/2014/02/24/3-days-to-kill","date":"2014-02-24 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" Dear Christophe Chatel, Ripper, I’ll be honest, I’ve never heard of a “ripper” before. But you can’t possibly be the first crewmember dedicated solely to tearing fabric to simulate knife slashes and bullet holes. But in a check of no less than a dozen recent action films, I couldn’t find anyone else with your title. Even stranger, the costume department on 3 Days to Kill required not one, but two of you carpet killers (say hi to Mathieu Chatagnon, would you?). Which made me wonder: is there some hidden level of detail and precision in director McG’s latest joint that I’m missing out on? Am I just not able to see that he’s treading (or shredding) new ground? The answer becomes crystal clear the moment Kevin Costner shows up—McG, despite his resumé, is just not very comfortable shooting action. He does, however, enjoying lingering on the aftermath. There’s nothing wrong with that. We’re introduced to Costner’s CIA operative Ethan Renner in a hotel room as he coolly walks through his latest mission accomplished massacre. Pillows are destroyed, curtains are mangled, chairs are flipped over and torn apart…oh yeah, and there’s, like, half-a-dozen bodies strewn about. You both did a serious number on the joint. This kicks off another one of those deadly assassin stories that Luc Besson (the co-writer) seems to crank out in his sleep. Only this time he’s ripping off a reverse-Crank formula in which our hero is dying, and, because he needs to be injected with a secret serum to prolong his life, passes out every time his heart rate increases. Bullets and bombs don’t register, but seeing his ex-wife Connie Nielson in lingerie sends him spinning to the floor. It’s this domestic side of the story – aka. the shooting days you were allowed to sleep through – that stretches what should be a 90 tidy minutes of action into two hours—and there are a couple big problems with that. For one: McG? Seriously? How is anyone supposed to take a director seriously when even his name is a joke? I get that he started out by making MTV videos, and that such singular handles are de rigueur in the music industry, but the film snob in me recoils at the idea of a ginger-headed white guy who has the moniker of an 80s rapper (Spike Jones, not included). But it’s not just his stupid name. McG’s work on the Charlie’s Angels films and the latest Terminator letdown haven’t helped his case. Here, at least, he’s giving us a few moments to care about. Hailee Steinfeld, playing Costner’s daughter, makes for a believable sassy-but-eventually-sorry teen—but at the other end of the spectrum we have to endure Amber Heard giving a ridiculously cartoonish performance that made me think I was still trapped in the hell that is Machete Kills. Worst of all, her cloths stay completely intact the whole time. Not cool, Christophe. It’s weird, too, that Costner’s wardrobe doesn’t suffer much duress. For the first two thirds of the movie, he’s never seen parading about Paris without his high-collar suede jacket, blue jeans and foulard, which somehow the French constantly confuse with looking like a “cowboy.” The majority of your work was reserved for mangling the costumes of the parade of bullet-fodder who make the mistake of crossing his path, including the Albino, the Wolf, and that poor nightclub bodyguard who Costner shoots in the toe while claiming his underage daughter (what did you use for that one? An awl? A Mikita power drill? Or did you actually fire a bullet through the shoe?). However you did it, the scenes that featured your work made the film work for me; it was the non-wardrobe malfunctions that tore me up.

All of the above. The Lone Ranger is  filled up to its extra-wide brim. No matter what an audience’s hopes, this movie will absolutely meet them. Unfortunately, to deliver on such a promise, Verbinski had to say yes to everything—including a running time of two-and-a-half hours. While many will certainly enjoy parts of this movie, they’ll have to sit through two hours and twenty minutes of the other stuff, too. This probably kept you busy, Mike. Saying yes to everything means dressing your sets, from scene to scene, in layers upon layers of red velvet drapery and fine desert sand. And you really do say yes to everything. To the sumptuous materials and carnival camp creations of Baz Luhrman’s Moulin Rouge! or The Great Gatsby and Tim Burton’s Helena Bonham Carter. To gritty-but-romanticized John Ford and Sergio Leone mountains, shacks, and bars. To blackish comedy and simple gags that recall everything from Jim Jarmusch’s Dead Man to a Disney movie (any one, really). There’s even the tiniest hint of the sort of creepy art film that Jodorowski or Rob Zombie might introduce to highlight the true instability of the real Wild West. These layers extend to the shot choices, the script, the acting, and the Oscar-nominated makeup. This complex pastiche even extends to the story itself, in which Armie Hammer becomes the Lone Ranger to reunite with his lost love, avenge his brother, avenge himself, solve a mystery, discover true friendship, and save the West. Fittingly, he both succeeds and fails in each of these endeavors, much like the movie succeeds and fails as any one of a number of different movies. Everything you guys do is a reference to another, better, more focused movie. None of the elements of the pastiche are original…save one. The Tonto of this movie, played by Johnny Depp, is an original. Sure, the character was stolen from Verbinski’s own Pirates of the Carribean series, but turning Keith Richards into Jack Sparrow, and Jack Sparrow into Tonto, and turning Tonto into the narrator – and in some ways a distant hero of the story (in that he is there with us to watch the movie unfold, like Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark) – is the film’s sole act of bravery. Looking at Depp in that makeup, I’m pretty sure no one else could have seen the potential in this guy. But it’s the obscene running time that keeps this from being a better movie. Cutting it would have involved making choices that the no one wanted to make. Like saying no to…anything. I could go on.

I mean, sure, there are lots of proverbial smoke and mirrors in this story of seven-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong. And, yes, it’s safe to say that there’s a smoke-like dark cloud that will forever overshadow Armstrong’s legacy. But Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney is not prone to such literal, stylized, Errol Morris-like re-enactments in his films. Instead, he tells the story of the disgraced super cyclist as a straight-up, old-school, talking-head, journalistic documentary. Or so it seems.  Like Armstrong, it appears that the secret to your success was to covertly manipulate the laws of nature. Didn’t you guys learn anything from making this film? Why would you need to amplify a scandal that is essentially sports world’s equivalent of faking the moon landing? Yes, Armstrong really did survive a severely advanced cancer. But the rest of the story – the one about a cyclist who, after his recovery, somehow became an even better athlete and completely dominated his field for years – needs an asterisk the size of Armstrong’s once lemon-sized testicle.  Yet amidst all the drug-pumping and blood-dumping deception is also a story of one of the most successful private fundraising campaigns ever. Juicy stuff, right? It should be—except that for too much of the film your boss Gibney seems to be trying to get over the fact that he too was also duped.  First-person narration is not the modus operandi for Gibney (best-known for Taxi to the Dark Side, Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer and We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks), and he spends unnecessary effort explaining the production history of the very film we’re watching. When shooting began back in 2009, this was going to be a much different film. After retiring at the top of his game in 2005 and thereafter being hounded by rumors of blood-doping, Armstrong hoped to silence his critics by returned to cycling in 2009. This is when Gibney came on board, expecting to document The Great Armstrong Comeback, Part Deux. Instead, Armstrong lied to his face, and to his cameras, and towed his familiar line of assuring everyone that the only scientific explanation for his super-human skills was hard work and dedication. Not entirely false, I suppose, seeing as, by Armstrong’s own admission, he simply treated cheating drug tests like a sport-within-a-sport. And, boy, did he win big at that one. After Armstrong finally confessed his sins to TV’s Saint Oprah in January 2013, Gibney convinced Armstrong to sit down once more and come clean. But this preoccupation with answers and evasion causes him to lose sight of the bigger picture—as well as many opportunities to broaden the story. We at least get plenty of interviews with Armstrong’s teammates and inner circle, leading to many revelations about mid-race blood transfusions and the surprising breadth of his network of collaborators.  But after two hours, I couldn’t help but feel that the film was becoming repetitive, still only scratching the surface.  Like something was still being hidden. Behind digital smoke, perhaps?

Your smooth, floating camera carries us straight into the heart of Rome, the once-great city so central to The Great Beauty. Like a ghost, we float through beautiful ruins, parks, and palaces. You glide past the sculpted busts of great men as sculpted, busty women smoke cigarettes beside them. Tourists and overweight locals take pictures and carelessly wash themselves in majestic fountains. Over and around the water we go, to a chorus of women singing a funereal hymn. And then smash cut to a party. The wild, decadent (and apparently pretty typical) party that changes everything for our hero Jep. In the same way your shake-resistant rig keeps the action perfectly framed, Jep’s 65th birthday party allows him to finally see his life clearly. The excitement and debauchery that drew him to the city as a young man is still there, but it no longer resonates with him. Call it a three-quarter-life crisis. You follow Jep on a conga line as he takes it all in, but there’s a hint of melancholy on actor Toni Servillo’s face. We quickly learn why through reflective voiceovers and dinner parties with his pompous friends. It seemed at times like I was watching a Denys Arcand film made by Baz Luhrman. But the story, and your busy camera-work, eventually slows down and takes its time—much like Jep and other men his age. The film is obsessed with aging. Botox parties are apparently de rigeur (when in Rome, right?). Characters admire millionaire child artists and begrudge their failing bodies. The city itself is described as “dying, distracting, and disappointing”—and to hammer that point home, Alessandro, you linger on the countless monuments of ancient culture. Even the half-sunk Costa Concordia cruise ship, seen briefly, serves to support that argument.  Though all of your shots are carefully composed, it takes a while before we’re really get a clear glimpse into Jep’s true headspace. His new relationship with an aging stripper (of course) gives him the opportunity to explicate some of his life lessons. This includes such gems as: remembering that every funeral you attend is time spent on a stage, which requires rehearsed lines and behaviour, such as never “stealing the show” from the family by crying. When Jep does break down at a friend’s passing, we understand that he’s also breaking away from the rigid self-imposed rules of class. Your camera, thankfully, doesn’t stray; director Paolo Sorrentino is not interested in ever losing his beautiful imagery the same way Jep loses his beautiful youth. More power to you.

They always have just the right amount of newness, weirdness, and cuteness for me to kill a couple of hours without dwelling on the film for very long after. And if nothing else, I can sit back and enjoy the pretty colours. However, The Wind Rises had me dwelling. It had me dwelling for quite a while. You helped Hayao Miyazaki’s cut together elements of history, romance, nostalgia, and fantasy on one of his undeniably gorgeous canvases, but they all jostle for attention in a film that doesn’t seem to know what kind of story it wants to tell. The story it does tell – the fanciful biography of WWII-era aircraft engineer Jiro Horikoshi, a boy with his head in the clouds who went on to design fighter planes for the Japanese military – spans about twenty years. You carry us through the timeline with a pace that matches the wind. And the wind – as one might imagine from the title – features prominently. From scenes of widespread devastation to the quiet, intimate moments between Jiro and his wife, the Wind asserts its presence, roaring through an airplane engine or gently disturbing a lock of hair. Like every one of your cuts, it leads the audience from one scene to the next. While this keeps the action from lagging, it’s also a bit too hurried. As the film floats between real-life and dream sequences, the narrative could have done with a more forgiving pace; there are scenes and moments that really deserve a pause, time for the audience to fully absorb the emotional impact. Even the moment when Jiro reflects upon the use of his planes as instruments of war has not time to settle before the Wind rolls through in a balletic, pastel swirl, and you cut away to the next scene. Another unfortunate consequence of this too-swift pacing is that it’s difficult to know where to focus. The love story, while sweet, is unsatisfying. And the historical elements are hard to fully appreciate because, in trying to fit them in alongside the romance and the dream sequences, you have to truncate major events like The Great Kanto Earthquake and the Pacific war. Which is a let-down, since Jiro’s dream of designing beautiful planes being co-opted by the Japanese war machine is perhaps the most compelling part of the story.  While I would have preferred that you and Miyazaki lingered on some of the more poignant moments in the film, I was happy enough to relinquish control to the wind.

For many born prior to the 1990s, it gave their childhood memories weight and warmth. I assume this is why director Rithy Panh chose you to be the star of The Missing Picture. Or maybe – and more likely – your clay figurines were the only way he could stomach recreating the horrors he endured at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. Before you correct me, I realize this film is not exactly “claymation,” but rather a unique filmmaking approach that uses archival footage and tableau designs of your clay figurines— sometimes combining both to create a sense of motion. For the most part, however, Pahn is trying to recreate still images: moments from his life that are burned into his memory but have been erased from all physical records.  The scale of suffering is so grand that only by miniaturizing everything can he process what happened.   This is why all the flaws in your clay men, women, and children are so essential. The divots in their faces give life to their frozen expressions. The hard edges and chipped corners are suggestive of the suffering they endured as they withered away from starvation and torture. Even the crude paint simulates the decay of their work camp uniforms and the erosion of their souls.  Your work is beautiful, haunting, and more human than anything that happened in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979. Of course, it wasn’t always so dire. Your work shines with colourful details as you recreate Panh’s childhood, when he roamed busy streets and snuck onto big bright film sets. The contrast between this and the hell-on-earth conditions imposed by Pol Pot’s communist regime are staggering, even in your molds. Pot was trying to create the Democratic Kampuchea – a society that combined Marxist ideology with tenets of Rousseau’s philosophy of the “noble savage”.  Luckily, all you had to do to create this new world was limit your palette and tools. It’s not the first documentary this year to find imaginative ways to reenact a genocide, nor is it the first film to explore the use of small figurines as a form of trauma therapy. Still, it feels as fresh and revelatory as a documentary can be.

For a while, we’re lulled into thinking we’re watching a quiet, slice-of-life film centered on this charming little love story. Then comes another gunshot, and Omar finds himself in the untenable position of being an informant to Rami, a Shin Bet agent, forced to betray his best friends and put his future with Nadia on the line. Omar wanders through a West Bank that is cramped and suffocating, with no chance of any kind of privacy. Indeed, the camera is always positioned like an eavesdropper, lingering just behind Omar’s shoulder, quietly intruding on his few stolen moments with Nadia. It’s a relief, then, when you draw us up and out, high above the ground, as Omar enters and leaves scenes by scrambling over walls, dropping from windows, or leaping from rooftop to rooftop. After a while, I was actually surprised when he used the front door to enter a friend’s house.   As Omar’s predicament worsened, I found myself increasingly eager for his next chance to spring up and away from the ground. Because things on the ground, frankly, are awful. When making like Spider-Man above the heads of his friends and neighbours, Omar is at his freest and most surefooted. All that await him on solid ground is war. Not only do paranoia and suspicion take hold of the characters, we lose all faith in them as well. As the plot progresses, we wonder which of Omar’s friends betrayed him, whether Nadia truly loves him, and whether Rami is genuinely starting to care about Omar or merely manipulating him. When the Israeli forces pursue him, yet again, through a darkened, labyrinthine marketplace, I wanted nothing more than for Omar to find the nearest wall and hoist himself up above the city once more. I wanted you and your jib to take Omar out of the world Abu-Assad had created on the ground.  I wanted you to take me there, too, to where none could follow.   Reaching skywards, Nat Status: Air Mail (3.5/5)"},{"title":"Live Tweeting the 2014 Oscars","url":"/2014/03/03/live-tweeting-the-2014-oscars","date":"2014-03-03 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":" #DearAcademy, With another Oscar telecast safely in the books, we can thank Twitter for once again making the show bearable.

Your first lesson appears to have been on the finer points of establishing mood; specifically, the psychological mood of a former cop turned renegade air marshal (as they do). All the essentials are present in the opening scenes of the film: grimy close-ups of cigarettes being sucked and stubbed out, spastic hand-held shots during moments of calm (you know, because even when he’s calm, he’s on the edge!). It’s also vital that you get the framing right when he reaches for his secret bottle of booze (always dark liquor; the clear stuff doesn’t have the same despairing screen presence), and director Jaume Collet-Serra, as you no doubt observed, keeps things appropriately tight. He even had Neeson pause and stare at the bottle right before tipping it back. You know, because he’s reluctant. They call this “complexity of character.” You might be a few years away from directing actors – probably after you assist a few second-unit assistant directors – but it’s important to pay attention to these small details. I hope you were taking notes, too, when the action moves onto the plane. When trapped in such a relatively small space, most filmmakers might do the obvious thing and exaggerate that sense of claustrophobia with long lenses and high-contrast lighting. Maybe bring back a bit of that shaky-cam from earlier. But it takes some ambition to draw the camera outside the plane to pan across the exterior windows for a series of reaction shots from the passengers. It’s even a bit daring to open up the space of the cabin with a free-floating camera that glides unobstructed over the tops of the seats. This jetliner, as a result, feels as wide open as a football field (an apt metaphor, don’t you think?—what with all the tackling that ensues). This operatic use of the camera is the most obvious clue that Non-Stop aspires to be, in style and substance, a Hitchcockian locked-room mystery. And the biggest surprise might be that it doesn’t entirely fail. For a while, the plot uncoils with mechanical precision; a anonymous terrorist dictates that every twenty minutes a passenger will die. And so they do, mostly in clever ways. But with Liam Neeson in the lead, throats must be punched, daughters must be avenged. How to balance these two juggernauts of narrative energy? How to marry the action and the suspense? The answer, in this case, is to flagellate your fun premise with a little bit of real-world socio-political commentary. And here, Jack, is where you learned your biggest lesson on the set of Non-Stop: that there’s nothing in our cultural memory so sacred that Hollywood can’t exploit if for gain. Even if the gain is something as innocuous as the film’s big reveal, when the real hijacker suddenly appears and does what all lame movie villains do: gives a speech that explains everything and means nothing. But don’t feel bad. You’re still learning. Even the most seasoned assistant director could have done little to fix such a fundamental story flaw. I just hope you read the fine print on your internship agreement: “Acceptance into the program is not a guarantee of graduation.” Remember what you learned while shooting the first 90 minutes out of 107. Forget everything else. Sincerely, Jared Status: Standard Delivery (3/5)"},{"title":"Grabbers","url":"/2014/03/06/grabbers","date":"2014-03-06 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":"At the risk of starting things off on the wrong foot, I must admit that the finer details of the casting process escape me. I have an image in my head of an assembly line of nervous actors hesitantly reading from a script while every few seconds a brusque voice interrupts: “Thank you! Next!” But I know it’s something a little more complex.  So I imagine, when it came time to hold auditions for Grabbers,  you must have been faced with the additional challenge of not only casting men and women who were a natural fit for each part, but who would be able to convincingly act drunk for nearly the entire third act—and do it without compromising any of their natural charisma. See, this could have easily been a terrible, terrible movie. The cast could have easily refused to take the screenplay’s key concept – alien sea creatures with a lethal allergy to alcohol – as seriously as they needed to. They could have chosen instead to unleash their inner vulgarians and turned the whole thing (especially the climatic pub siege) into an obnoxious, unfunny nightmare of Happy Madison proportions.  But they didn’t. And it was all because of your casting. You really have assembled one of the most likeable genre film casts I’ve seen in years.  Richard Coyle and Ruth Bradley are outstanding as two constantly at-odds police officers; they  share a chemistry that hearkens back to the Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward in Tremors, which is also a clear inspiration for this film’s structure (not that I’m complaining, mind you; if anything, we need more movies cut from the Tremors mold).  Bradley, in particular, deserves special mention. Her straight-laced and strictly-by-the-book character becomes drunk for possibly the first time ever, and she displays absolutely amazing comedic timing, almost stealing the entire show.   I really don’t know how you did it, but every other character – even relatively minor ones – just feel so…right.  From the husband and wife tavern owners, to the I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-Colin-Hanks marine biologist, to the crusty town drunk—every member of the cast leaves such a positive impression that I didn’t want a single person to die (which is odd, considering my normally bloodthirsty nature).  Which brings me to what I perhaps enjoyed the most about Grabbers: the relatively low body count.  Sure, there will be those who think that having so many left standing by the end is a fault, that it somehow makes everything they saw less worthwhile. But this isn’t that type of movie. It isn’t interested in asking you to invest in characters only to violently take them away;. And that’s quite refreshing in an age when every horror movie aspires to be as gritty and hardcore as possible.  Grabbers is just so engaging, and has such an infectious sense of fun, that one can even overlook the lack of real scares. Save, of course, for when the enormous “King” grabber attacks that hapless couple about midway through the film. I think the greatest compliment I can offer you is that if the monsters were completely removed from this movie, the actors would still be appealing enough to get me all the way through to the end. And that’s definitely thanks to you. Cheers, Kelan Young"},{"title":"300: Rise of an Empire","url":"/2014/03/07/300-rise-of-an-empire","date":"2014-03-07 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["reviews"],"body":"You were a pretty savvy guy, and lived though a great age of Hellenic theater, so you’re probably familiar with how the facts of history can be bent and stretched by a dramatist. And there’s no better way to measure what values are held most sacred by a particular culture than to observe how those facts are bent and stretched. Back in 472 BCE when the Aeschylus dramatized the events of the Greco-Persian War in the The Persians, his concern was for divine retribution. Ideas of fate and morality were a popular theme back then (his play even won first prize at that year’s Dionysian festival). You didn’t get a mention in that one, but you’re a big part of a new piece of drama—it’s called 300: Rise of an Empire, and it’s, uh…a movie. Which is like a play, but projected onto a wall. Like a living painting. You see, we’ve figured out how to refract light onto a surface in order to capture the image of… Nevermind. What I wanted to tell you – because I thought you might be curious – is how you’re being remembered here in the 21st Century. Like The Persians, this is a sequel. The first story’s protagonist was one of your contemporaries, the Spartan king Leonidas, and it (sort of) documented his death at the Battle of Thermopylae. This was created in 2006, and a country known as America (where the film was produced) had recently suffered a terrible tragedy. Such mass casualties are a rare occurrence here in the future, so in the air hung a distinct (but unspoken) desire for blood, which, in these enlightened times, expressed itself in strange ways. The original 300 was one of those ways. The story’s most obvious themes – vengeance, martyrdom, hubris – were subsumed by a weird commixture of leitmotifs that included personal freedom and resistance to oppression (which you might find hilarious, since you lived through a time when the Spartans were the most oppressive oppressors the world had ever known). In your day, military brinksmanship was guided by “Timé”—which, roughly translated into contemporary English, means worth or honor. Timé was how you old-school Greeks measured yourselves against one another. As the historian J.E. Lendon writes in Song of Wrath (think of him as a sort of modern-day Thucydides): “Timé was thought to have a real, almost physical existence within the world. It could be taken by one man from another; it could be captured in war.” Today, particularly in the West (way past the borders of the world you know), exceptionalism is the default mode of social, political and cultural discourse. We are responsible only for ourselves. Where that self-interest coincides with the interests of the larger global community, great! But, for the most part, we fight and die for our right to choose the conditions of our own immediate existence. That’s not entirely a bad thing. But it’s a concept that I’m guessing you’re unfamiliar with. Sure, Athens was the birthplace of democracy, and you were, in fact, one of its progenitors – a populist, a defender of the lower classes (a real man of the people, as we say nowadays) – but we think of democracy in much different terms now. We think of it in terms of freedom.  Indeed, as much as things change, they stay exactly the same. Freedom is the way we measure ourselves against other nations; the idea to which we have ascribed a physical realness that it does not possess; the thing we are constantly afraid might be taken from us by other men. It’s our timé. So, what about this movie? As a lifelong advocate for the Athenian navy, you’ll be happy to know there are lots of boats. The film even begins – as most stories of Athens’ rise to military greatness (most notably John Hale’s amazing book Lords of the Sea) – with your speech before the Athenian council. Though, in this version, you’re less concerned with the economics and logistics of building up Athenian naval power than you are with recruiting the Spartans to join your cause (yes, yes, I know; the inferior design of their warships made them practically useless beside your fast and agile triremes, but the storytellers need them in there for the sake of continuity). What follows, as expected, is a blending and blurring of fact and fiction. We get a cool cameo from the Hellespont. And when you’re drawn into battle, they show your ships arranged in the classic kyklos defensive formation. But I’m pretty sure you didn’t hate-sex the Persian naval commander Artemesia on top of her war map. And I won’t even ask if you did or didn’t explode out of the ocean on a flaming horse to board an enemy ship and behead its commander… But these are our modern myths, and this is how we tell them: in super slow-motion, in vibrant colors. The movie is rather beautiful, actually. The roiling oceans, the roiling clouds. Everything roils. Even the starscapes. In the opening scene, as you lead a charging regiment at the Battle of Marathon, lightning drips lazily from the sky in fluorescent zigzags. It’s more affecting than perhaps it deserves to be. The historical distortion most likely to displease you comes at the climax of the story (which is supposed to be the Battle of Salamis, though the tactic that led you to victory there – drawing the larger Persian boats into the straits where they became trapped among the rocks and made easy targets – occurs much earlier in the film). When all seems lost, the Greek boats smashed and sinking, you look towards the horizon and see… Well, I’d rather not upset you. Just know that a couple hundred years after your time, the Latin phrase deus ex machina is invented in reference to the popular devices of Greek tragedy, and it applies here. But maybe straying from the truth a bit isn’t a bad thing. After all, the film ends with you charging heroically towards the camera, swinging your sword, cutting your way through the Persian hordes in kaleidoscopic gushes of blood. If it had been even twenty minutes longer, we might have gotten to the part where you were declared a traitor and exiled by your fellow Athenians. Or even far enough to depict your narrow escape into Asia Minor, where you made contact with Artaxerxes – the son of this film’s vainglorious, gilded antagonist – and offered him your services. Yours was a happy ending, of sorts; Plutarch wrote that the honors you enjoyed in the Persian King’s court were “far beyond those paid to other foreigners,” and, unlike Leonidas, you passed away at a respectable old age and under peaceful circumstances. So perhaps it’s best to be remembered as you are in this film. As a freedom-fighter, a swordsman (in both meanings of the word), and rich in those traits we find so appealing in this modern age: youth, handsomeness, and possessed of finely articulated abdominal muscles.

You’re credited as Jake Gyllenhaal’s double in Enemy. Except Jake Gyllenhaal also plays his own double in Enemy. Meaning you did double the double duty. Whenever Gyllenhaal looks into his own eyes, he’s actually looking into yours. But really, he’s looking at himself, because as far as this film’s concerned, you don’t exist. But of course you do, right? I’m talking to you right now. I looked you up in the film’s credits, just like Gyllenhaal does in the… Wait a second. Sorry, Gord. I may have just inadvertently mixed us up with the mobius strip mindbender that is Denis Villeneuve’s Enemy. The film is based on José Saramago’s novel, The Double. The fact the two otherwise identical stories go by different names is interesting. Enemies and doubles aren’t exactly synonymous (imagine being credited as Jake Gyllenhaal’s Enemy?), so this new identity re-orients the way we understand the film. It’s also nice bit of meta-textual symmetry for the two characters in the film itself. After all, why simply duplicate the original when you can appropriate what’s inside and call it something else? Something antithetical, no less, that reflects back on the source to help us find new meaning… I’m doing it again, aren’t I? Well, it’s just going to be that kind of letter. Because it’s that kind of film. The kind where a man watches a “local” film that a friend half-heartedly recommended (the way we do here in Canada). After some reflection, he scrolls through the credits to find the name of the person he wants to connect with. Someone whose work really stood out for him. He does some research about the person online, gathering basic info—after all, he needs to get a better sense of how to approach the situation, lest he mess the whole thing up. Honestly, there were times I couldn’t tell if I was watching a movie or a documentary about Dear Cast and Crew. This begs the question: will anyone else besides me relate to – or be consumed by – this picture? Faithful Donnie Darko fans will no doubt enjoy going down a similarly dark, but more mature and introspective, rabbit hole with their old pal Gyllenhaal. Arachno-ethusiasts (no, not that kind) will also enjoy numerous creepy connections: manifestations, dream-sequences, and the web-like infrastructure of Toronto’s TTC power lines. In fact, everyone in that city should probably see this “local” film, which features Toronto as just another a smoggy, anonymous metropolis. Even the familiar architecture – like those twin condos shaped like curved bodies – takes on a more menacing presence. Much more than, say, the city’s other doubles-dabbling histoire du jour, Orphan Black. There are plenty of great doppelgänger films to compare with Enemy. They include The Double Life of Veronique, Solaris, Vertigo, um… Mulitiplicty? But the strength of this one is that it acts like it’s the first and only version. With that kind of confidence, it presents itself as being wholly unique. Don’t we all? Doubling back, Christopher P.S. Forgive me if I don’t call your agency to track you down. Someone needs to break the cycle."},{"title":"Blackfish","url":"/2014/03/12/blackfish","date":"2014-03-12 00:00:00 -0400","categories":["reviews"],"body":"Did you enjoy your visit to Seaworld as much as I did? Judging from the footage in the cheesy info-spot that was shown on the Jumbotron at Shamu Stadium, it sure looks like you did. This, of course, was back in the 80s. I was there in ‘81, and had my picture taken with Shamu. I even bought a plush whale toy and a Seaworld hat that I wore non-stop for the next year. Like most 8 year-olds, I thought Shamu was a superstar. I didn’t consider the circumstances under which he and the other animal performers lived. But hey, it was the 80s—people smoked on planes and used baby oil instead of sunscreen. We didn’t know any better.  But we do now. At least we should, according to the makers of the documentary Blackfish. Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite initially set out to investigate how Dawn Brancheau, an experienced trainer, could be killed by a whale. In doing so, she uncovered the sad and shocking truth behind one of America’s most popular theme parks. Blackfish reveals the true implications of keeping killer whales in captivity for our amusement. In the aforementioned video clip, you enlightened Seaworld visitors with your trademark sonorous voice about how difficult it is to become an animal trainer. The former Seaworld trainers interviewed in Blackfish were all inspired to work with whales after visiting the park as children, but imagined (as you implied) that the job would involve years of intensive education in Marine biology. This, however, is not the case. Turns out, the less they knew about killer whales, the better. In fact, the documentary exposes a culture of systematic misinformation at Seaworld, from basic knowledge about the animals in their charge, to the backstory of Tilikum, the killer whale at the heart of Blackfish’s tragic narrative. I can’t imagine you knew any of this when you agreed to make your Seaworld video. In 1991, Sealand of the Pacific in Victoria B.C. was the kind of run-down attraction people went to ironically. There was no way they could have afforded to hire a star of your caliber to film an entertaining short. It was little more than a penned in harbour that kept whales in dark, cramped cells when they weren’t performing. Having been trained by negative reinforcement, Tilikum was Sealand’s ticking time bomb. When he drowned his trainer Keltie Byrne after a show, the owners closed the park and sold Tilikum to Seaworld Orlando, ostensibly to be used as a breeder. None of the Seaworld trainers knew Tilikum was dangerous. But apparently the higher-ups did, and it didn’t stop them from allowing him to perform.  He would go on to kill two more times. We learn, from an ashamed former fisherman who trapped whales in Puget Sound in the 70s, that after a baby whale was separated from it’s pod and netted, the rest of its family would remain close by and cry in dismay. He tearfully recalled his job as nothing more than kidnapping. We meet a neuroscientist who has studied whale’s brains, noting that they have a section that humans don’t possess; a section that suggests they have highly elaborate emotional capabilities. But it’s more than just neuroscience. Whales have a complex social system wherein they are bonded to their pod for life. Forcing artificial bonds on them in captivity almost always results in aggression. In short, the practice of catching, training, and confining whales creates the perfect conditions under which a whale will kill. And how do we know this isn’t instinctual behavior? Because, as we learn, there has never been an instance in which an Orca has killed a human in the wild. I get the feeling that none of this information was in your script. With extensive interviews and an impressive amount of footage, Cowperthwaite stops just short of exploitation. We see bloodied, injured whales and quick cuts of many different trainers over the years being nearly drowned or crushed, a stark contrast to the sunny (yet misleading) commercials and videos (like yours) fed to the public. If this paints a one-sided picture, it might be because, despite numerous requests, Seaworld refused to participate in the making of this film. Though I’m not sure they could have made a convincing case in their favour.  It doesn’t help that they hired Darth Vader.

What other modern frivolity mocks both environmentalism and common sense? The answer is simple: movies about muscle cars (says the Fast & Furious apologist). Yet Dreamworks, Disney, Electronic Arts, along with the other makers of Need for Speed, hired you to help cut back their carbon footprint.  Good on them. In fact, they really take the whole reduce, reuse, and recycle thing to heart. Where to start? You must have warned them against the dangers of the carbon monoxide spewing from the actors’ mouths, so, thankfully, any dialogue that might create a nuanced sense of character is kept to a minimum. The black guy is sassy, the Latino guy is scary, the short guy is spunky—you know the drill. There are custom cars, sure, but the characters are stock. Throw in a childhood rival and a know-it-all love interest, and BAM!—you’re off to the races. Your main wheelman is Aaron Paul, who, in terms of conserving energy, might be doing the best job of the entire cast. He does a lot of brooding and idle gazing, but at least he’s got a good engine under the hood. To my pleasant surprise – despite how Breaking Bad ended – he didn’t just drive his Jesse Pinkman character straight into this film. Instead, he’s the everyman hero, the Ford pick-up truck—no fuss, no muss, just get the job done. You certainly made sure that the filmmakers stuck to a strict reuse policy. Hence the title, appropriated from a video game, and the numerous dashboard shots pulled directly from a 90s arcade machine. Not that the film ever feels like CGI (in fact, the studio rep at my screening made sure to point out how all the car shots in the film are real).  This anti-Speed Racer approach was a breath of fresh air, actually; the stakes are so low, plot-wise, that it was nice to see a bit of substance up on the screen.  Even the star is a used car: a Shelby Mustang that must have been driven straight of the set of Getaway. This conscientious salvaging of props  from even worse films is a true testament to your positive influence. I was most impressed, however, by how well you encouraged them to recycle. Rather than pollute the world with an original idea, you made sure to stick with familiar plot points, archetypes, and visual styles. In a great bit of biosphere-friendly reprocessing, actual scenes are lifted straight out of far superior Speed-related films (like hitting a homeless person’s shopping cart). But by including actual references to more successful car chase films (like Bullit, and, yes, Speed), director Scott Waugh advertises his decision to recycle. He must know that, just like when we see those three iconic folded arrows, there’s comfort to be found in knowing a product is made up of other junk. This is how Hollywood really remains sustainable.

Set the Wayback Machi…, er, set yourself to 1983, destination: a small French Canadian town. My childhood living room, to be precise, where, with the obvious exception of hockey, there was only one other show I could watch with my much older siblings and parents that we unanimously enjoyed. It was fast-paced, pun-filled grown-up silliness masquerading as a kids show. You’d remember it as the classic 1960s cartoon The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show.  Now set yourself to a couple of months ago, destination: my current home when I first heard about ‘Mr. Peabody & Sherman, the feature length 3D animated movie based on Peabody’s Improbable History, a popular segment of The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show where you first appeared. You’ll know you’ve found me when you hear the moribund vestiges of my childhood groan and crumble under the weight of too many unnecessary and predictably disappointing cartoon re-boots. Fun fact: it’s the same noise Jenga blocks make when falling onto a smoked-glass coffee table while an episode of C.H.I.P.S. plays in the background.  Smurfs, Transformers, Alvin and the Chipmunks, all of those were bad enough, but my beloved Peabody & Sherman? Hadn’t we learned anything from the embarrassing debacle that was the 2000 live action movie version of Rocky & Bullwinkle starring DeNiro? What’s the point of having a time-machine to go back in history if not for the express purpose to avoid repeating its mistakes? In this case, history will show I was wrong. Mr. Peabody is the titular genius dog, Sherman is his precocious adopted boy, and you are the time machine, Peabody’s ultimate teaching tool. When Sherman gets bullied at school by mean girl Penny and reacts violently, Mr. Peabody’s competence as a parent is called into question. An effort to restore the peace backfires when Peabody invites Penny’s parents and gruff social worker Ms. Grunion to his penthouse while Sherman and Penny make off with the Wayback Machine, eventually causing a rip in the space time continuum.  From the get-go this film seeks to reassure its longtime fans that they are indeed in good hands. The Dreamworks SKG ‘child fishing from the crescent moon’ intro is replaced by a black and white old school Sherman, an indication that despite the slick, 3D gimmickry and 21st century pacing, we are - at least tonally - on familiar ground. Ty Burrell’s Peabody is more charm than smarm in this iteration, but his penthouse, car and manner are all decidedly mid-century. Peabody’s trademark puns are groan-inducing, as they should be. They’re there not to make you laugh, but to prove that you got the reference. It’s refreshing to see a kid’s film that encourages intelligence over beauty or brawn. Trying to appeal to both kids and adults is not an easy feat, one side usually benefits more than the other, and in this case, it’s the over 30 crowd that wins. Sherman’s Stephen Hawking lunchbox, a montage of Peabody and Sherman spending time together set to John Lennon’s ‘Beautiful Boy’, and Bill Clinton excusing Sherman’s theft of you by saying, “I’ve done worse”, are obviously not references intended for little pitchers. When the tear in the fabric of the space time continuum starts dropping famous historical figures into present day, the film veers into Bill & Ted territory: Mel Brooks’ Einstein with a Rubix cube yells at a car, “I’m walkin’ here!”, Beethoven plays Dance Dance Revolution and Leonardo DaVinci tries his hand at Banksy-esque street art. This film not-too subtly says to its younger audience, “if you don’t get it, go home and Google it.”  The themes here are simple; wanting to belong, the importance of family and standing up for what you believe in. But like most time travel films, the fun is in the journey, not the destination. If you set yourself to the movie theatre a few days ago, you’ll find my brother, his kids, and I waiting for the film to start. I’m the one with the lowered expectations. But as I watched my 7-year-old niece, the only non-teenager in her family, laugh at the jokes she got, pretend to laugh at the jokes she didn’t, and love every minute she spent with her family, I felt a strong wave of déjà vu. Maybe history does repeat itself, and hey, you’d know.

Not writing to you would have meant that Barry Aldrich’s documentary Filthy Gorgeous: The Bob Guccione Story had made some interesting choices (successful or not) and didn’t simply rip off its musical stylings from Boogie Nights. Sadly, as the films opened with Penthouse founder Bob Guccione photographing a nude model, The Chakachas’ Jungle Fever started to play and I felt my heart sink. Not that there’s anything intrinsically wrong with taking inspiration from other sources. Boogie Nights itself clearly took its cue from Martin Scorsese’s approach to building a soundtrack. But the film has to make the music an integral part of the storytelling, not mere sonic wallpaper that happens to have been released around the time the story is taking place. Unfortunately, this unimaginative approach to scoring a film with pop songs is symptomatic of Filthy Gorgeous’s overall problems. There’s an interesting story here; it’s just not interestingly told. For a documentary that seems to aspire to showcase the many facets of Bob Guccione –pornographer, artist, renaissance man! – this is a very surface-level enterprise. There’s a lot of talk of Bob Guccione in this film, but not much of Guccione himself (the fact that he died in 2010 doesn’t mean he can’t be a presence; Roger Smith’s shadow was cast over every scene in  Michael Moore’s Roger and Me, and he never formally appeared in the film—then again, maybe that’s because Moore’s film is all about the effect’s Smith’s business decisions have on the film’s subjects, while Filthy Gorgeous is focused on events that happened to Guccione; simply put, he’s not the protagonist of his own story). Much like the use of music, there’s another stylistic decision that undermines what Aldrich is (I think) trying to accomplish. Structurally, Guccione’s life is divided into segments based on his business endeavours: starting Penthouse magazine; the artistic and financial disaster that was Caligula; expanding his publishing empire to include Omni and other more mainstream titles (before its collapse and eventual bankruptcy). It all feels like it should have the pop culture zip of a triple-X take on Citizen Kane, but while the various interviewees (including Guccione’s two sons) speak often of his desire, passion, and stubbornness when it came to topics like art, journalism, and liberty, we’re constantly missing the detail that creates a truly personal portrait.  Consider the fact that Bob Guccione Jr. is a producer of this film, yet spent most of the last 20 years of his father’s life estranged from him. What more could he tell of his father’s story than the scantest surface details? And what more could your soundtrack do than score those moments in the most obvious, uninteresting way?

I was a fan, too, but your opening lyrics encapsulated how I felt about the whole endeavor: A long time ago, we used to be friends But I haven’t thought of you lately at all. You were written in 2003 by alt-rockers The Dandy Warhols, and, a year later, were appropriated by Rob Thomas as the theme song for his teenage gumshoe series. With your cheeky lyrics, followed by that poppy, bubblegum hook and rhythmic clapping, you get my vote as the go-to song for every high school reunion.  And watching the Veronica Mars movie kind of feels like going to a reunion. You’re excited to see all your former friends, to reminisce about the good old days. But imagine you’re going to your spouse’s reunion; it’s a different experience entirely. You don’t know anybody, the inside jokes go over your head, and you spend the night smiling wanly while waiting for it to finally be over. This film definitely falls into the former category. It’s an unapologetic Veronica Mars reunion, by the fans, for the fans. And what happens at this reunion? Nine years have passed, and Veronica is on the verge of passing the bar exam and getting hired by a big-time New York law firm. Then she gets a phone call from her bad-boy ex, Logan Echolls, the son of a movie star who, it turns out,  is accused of murdering his a Lady Gaga-esque pop-star girlfriend. Despite the safety of her New York life (her current boyfriend is her college friend-zone casualty, the boring as dirt Piz) she returns to Neptune to help clear Logan’s name, and, of course, falls right back into her former private investigator role. Rob Thomas crafted the high-contrast opening sequence as Cliff Notes for the uninitiated, speeding through Veronica’s history like a runaway slide projector, and the rest of the film keeps that pace. This works when the narrative is episodic, like it was on TV, but in feature-length format the tempo is draining. When you show up, you’re sung by a busker in front of the NPR studio where Piz works, and I heard the audience give a warm “ahhh” in recognition. The film elicits this response many times, steadily ticking off the boxes on every fan’s checklist. Logan’s surfer-douche roomie Dick says something inappropriate? Check! Veronica does something illegal to gain information? Check! Veronica mentions the failed FBI pilot spin-off? Check! All this self-referential back-slapping seems a little too exclusionary for a show that took such pride in celebrating the outsider.  When fans of Firefly (that other famously underrated-then-cancelled show) made their campaign for a film, the result was Serenity, a movie that stands on its own merit, that is accessible enough for non-fans to enjoy regardless of whether they got the ‘two by two, hands of blue’ references. Maybe I had hoped that a movie based on a show that had been praised and loved for being so sharp would find a less obvious and more clever way to give the fans what they paid for. This effort is a tad too ‘Greatest Hits Compilation’ for my tastes. Once upon a time, Veronica was popular. Then she was an outcast who battled her loneliness by righting those who had been wronged. Playing against type and being wise beyond her years made people (myself among them) fall in love with her and with the show. But part of what made our hero so endearing was that she was a kid playing dress-up in a grown-up world. Now an adult, Veronica’s schtick is reminiscent of putting your favourite song on repeat: sure, it’s fun for awhile, but it gets old fast.  Still friends, minus the benefits, Di"}]}
