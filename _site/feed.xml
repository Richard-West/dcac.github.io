				<title>A Conversation with Jess Gonchor, Production Designer</title>
				<description>&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the set of &lt;em&gt;Hail, Caesar!&lt;/em&gt; – his sixth film with the Joel and Ethan Coen – Academy Award-nominated Production Designer Joss Gonchor talks to Christopher Redmond about his craft, his career, and what it takes to rise through the ranks in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you want to become a Production Designer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason I always felt that I had an eye for what could tell a story. What looks good and what does not look good to tell a story. Not in context to the world, but what is a background that is going to help tell a story. If there was an actor out there that couldn&amp;#39;t speak, what could support telling a story visually? I fell into studio set building, which I also loved, and I embraced that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now you&amp;#39;re working on your sixth Coen Brother&amp;#39;s film, &lt;em&gt;Hail, Caesar!&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I&amp;#39;m sort of back in Hollywood for the first time on a big build movie. We have six sound stages that we&amp;#39;re building sets on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the guys, one of the painters that&amp;#39;s on the crew, came up to me and goes, &amp;quot;Hey, do you remember me? It&amp;#39;s Bobby so-and-so.&amp;quot; And I&amp;#39;m like, &amp;quot;Yeah, I remember you.&amp;quot; And he goes, &amp;quot;Congratulations,&amp;quot; and he sort of nudged the guy next to him, and he goes ,&amp;quot;this is a guy twenty years ago who said &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m gonna be a production designer some day,&amp;#39; and we all laughed.&amp;quot; But here I am! And I&amp;#39;ve got a couple hundred people working on this job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking at your resumé, it really seems like you worked your way up through the art department to get to where you are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s sort of been my path, and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s the normal path, because you do get labeled in this business for something that you do—especially if you&amp;#39;re good at it. It&amp;#39;s hard to work your way out of that type of thing sometimes. But I always got to the point where I wasn&amp;#39;t fed up with it, but I just sort of had enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building sets ran their course with me. Being in charge of people that were building the sets ran its course. And then drawing the sets up for people to build ran its course. And then telling the people who draw the sets up how to draw them up, being an art director, ran it&amp;#39;s course. And then the opportunity to start designing came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How exactly did you get your first gig as a production designer on a film?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very hard to get my first job doing it, so I went into commercial production design and started designing commercials. I had hoped that I would do a good enough job in that for someone to recognize my work. But as luck would have it, and as hard work would have it, I worked with Bennett Miller on a lot of commercials, and he had yet to direct something. So he turned to me one day and said, &amp;quot;Jess, you want to go to Winnipeg and do a movie about Truman Capote?&amp;quot; And I was like, &amp;quot;Sure, let&amp;#39;s go!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, at least my work was recognized and people could see that I had an eye and I could tell a story visually, and I could design something, and I could be fiscally responsible for a budget. There&amp;#39;s so many things that go around for production design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could you define, in your own words, what it is that a production designer does?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that the responsibility of the production designer is to tell a story visually. Take away all the acting and take away all the singing and all the performance and see a movie without that. Does it still tell a story if words aren&amp;#39;t spoken? Does it still mean something? Does it move itself along page-by-page visually? That&amp;#39;s what a production designer does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You read a script and you figure out, &amp;quot;Okay, how can I tell this story visually?&amp;quot; And you have to go out into the world and say, &amp;quot;Okay, this is going to have to be a practical location where we&amp;#39;ll fix up and do something, then we&amp;#39;re going to have to go to a stage for this. Then we&amp;#39;re going to go shoot a scene on a train, then we&amp;#39;re going to go back to the set.&amp;quot; So you have to put a lot of pieces together. And then you have to answer to a dollar amount. You really can&amp;#39;t go over, or you may be looked at as somebody who&amp;#39;s too extravagant, someone who doesn&amp;#39;t understand what it takes just to shoot a scene and just build two walls if that&amp;#39;s all you&amp;#39;re going to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a big believer in a concept for a movie. Like, what am I trying to get out of the production design? What&amp;#39;s it trying to say? Is there a colour palette or style that I&amp;#39;m working with? Am I helping keep pace with my scenery for the movie?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s anything from cars, to practical sets, to big giant stage builds, to a pen that somebody&amp;#39;s writing with or a piece of paper that they&amp;#39;re writing on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you get involved with the Coen brothers? What attracted them to you? I assume it was easy to be attracted to them…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I was always a fan of their movies. Listen, a lot of this business is timing. Across the board, with actors, designers, all sorts of people. A lot of this has to do with timing. &lt;em&gt;Capote&lt;/em&gt; had just came out, they saw it, and they were looking for someone to design &lt;em&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;/em&gt;. I know that they interviewed a lot of people and they were exhausted with that (laughs). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, truth to be told, the story is I was on a movie, and they called my agent after they saw &lt;em&gt;Capote&lt;/em&gt; and said, &amp;quot;Hey, this guy Jess…we want to talk to him. He may fit into our family over here. We&amp;#39;re pretty down to earth, pretty low-budget, pretty simple. When we overstate the look of something, it&amp;#39;s still understated in a way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was on a movie and I was unavailable and the movie went down. My agent said, hold on, and she got me an interview with the guys. So I put together some really nice images of what I thought, after reading the script, what &lt;em&gt;No Country&lt;/em&gt; should look like. And we hit it off. Since then I&amp;#39;ve learned what they like, they&amp;#39;ve learned what I like, and together we&amp;#39;ve formed a bond of just being on the same page for filmmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And they obviously trust you with their designing movies now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the trust that they instil in me is pretty amazing. I&amp;#39;m super thankful for that. They know that I get them, so there&amp;#39;s a trust now. Yes, there&amp;#39;s a lot – a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; – dialogue between us, but this is the sixth movie I&amp;#39;ve made with them right now, so we know how to gauge it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All through the first movie we did, I think I came out of the gate with something special, and they recognized it and then obviously things worked out after. It takes a lot of hard work, but it worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had an art director tell me to ask this question: what percentage of your vision do you feel shows up in the final film?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um, 90 per cent. I mean, what else is there? It&amp;#39;s all your vision. If they use something or not, it&amp;#39;s all… I mean I don&amp;#39;t know. I might go to 100 per cent. I don&amp;#39;t want to be a pig about it, but… maybe not. Let&amp;#39;s just say 90. That&amp;#39;s a tough question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I name a couple of your films can you describe them to me from a production designer&amp;#39;s point of view? Let&amp;#39;s start with Capote.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bleak. Bleak, desperate, telling a story of this family that was murdered in cold blood, and the two guys that were guilty of it. Like an Andrew Wyeth painting, it&amp;#39;s just really wintery, cold. It had to feel vulnerable, bleak. If I sewed it all up tight in a blanket I would say it&amp;#39;s…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winnipeg?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(laughs) Winnipeg was the perfect place to go, when it was all said and done. But it was like a still life painting to me, and I still feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about The Devil Wear&amp;#39;s Prada?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you something. I did not have a movie out yet that I could call my own. I had art directed a bunch, but &lt;em&gt;Capote&lt;/em&gt; wasn&amp;#39;t out yet. I interviewed with the director and the producer and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure if they saw &lt;em&gt;Capote&lt;/em&gt;, I would not have been the guy to get that job! (laughs). It was complete polar opposite of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I remember this was in 2005 and I had just got my first iPod and it was a white one with silver on the back and this black dial. I had this thing and I had a few photos of Vogue, and this that, but I had this iPod in my pocket. And they asked me, &amp;quot;so what do you think the movie is?&amp;quot; And I pulled out this brand new, shiny iPod, and I said: &amp;quot;I think this is what the movie looks like.&amp;quot; David Frankel and Wendy Finerman were like, &amp;quot;Hmm, okay, tell us more.&amp;quot; So that sort of piqued their interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it was just high fashion, polished colours, beautiful shades of white with some colour mixed in. It is what it was. It was opening up a 500-page issue of Vogue magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then going to No Country For Old Men?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;No Country&lt;/em&gt;, I had a very specific colour palette in mind for that too. (pauses) It feels like an easy one but it was sort of a hard one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also a sense of being desperate. To me, the whole movie was about the colours of the desert. Being out in harsh environments. I just started to look at shapes against the sky. Just sort of open land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/features/inline/a-conversation-with-jess-gonchor-production-designer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jess Gonchor&amp;#39;s colour palette for No Country for Old Men&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started looking at negative space for that movie. I don&amp;#39;t want to get too deep, but I was just embracing the sky in everything we did. So instead of looking at the outline of a trailer, I sort of looked at it upside down like, &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s the outline of the sky?&amp;quot;.It helped me to define the landscape. The landscape of West Texas and how hot it was and how thirsty you were out there. Getting that message across of space and dessert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the colour palette I made for that: I knocked off a Rothko painting and had pretty much just the colours you would find in the West Texas desert. I put a splatter of blood to top it off. So it was a few shades of brown, a shade of rust, and shade of concrete, and then a spatter of blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you communicate your vision to the rest of the department exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have extensive, extensive research done. We plaster our department with research. Our entire hallway (for &lt;em&gt;Hail, Caesar!&lt;/em&gt;), which probably runs 300 feet—both sides of the hallway are covered with research of the era. The period movies like a Gene Kelly movie, a song and dance thing, an Ester Williams thing, a Nöel Coward thing. All of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I&amp;#39;ll have my concepts and illustrations and drawings on the other side of the hallways. And I&amp;#39;ll break it down into scenes, so everybody on the whole movie can walk through the hallways and see, &amp;quot;Oh, we open in a Chinese restaurant, here&amp;#39;s the research on it.&amp;quot; This takes a couple of months but someone can walk through the whole movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you do on a smaller film like Capote?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did on &lt;em&gt;Capote&lt;/em&gt; was I made up a colour palette, a 5x7 card, with six colours on it. I laminated the card and on one side I had the colours on it, and on the other side I had my name and my cell number. I punched a hole in it and put a little clip on it and I gave it to all the people on the set, namely the set PAs. I said, &amp;quot;If anybody sees any colour that is not on this card, call me up and I will get it out of this set. I don&amp;#39;t care if it&amp;#39;s a pen, a car, a hat, you know what I mean?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I always make up some kind of colour palette to get on board with the costume designer, and sometimes he or she will agree on another colour, but I feel it&amp;#39;s important to maintain continuity between something like that and the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how big was your card for The Lone Ranger? It couldn&amp;#39;t have been just 5x7.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Laughs) No, it wasn&amp;#39;t. It wasn&amp;#39;t. But that was a movie about landscapes too. You know that was really a true Western. It didn&amp;#39;t want to be a pulp Western, like a Roy Rogers thing. It wanted to be a void of a lot of colour. Like reds. There was a little bit here and there, but mainly we really tried to stay true to the old John Ford Westerns. Almost black and white type of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell me about your different approach between &lt;em&gt;The Lone Ranger&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;True Grit&lt;/em&gt;? Two Westerns, but a very different approach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, the budget. &lt;em&gt;Lone Ranger&lt;/em&gt; was ten times the budget that &lt;em&gt;True Grit&lt;/em&gt; was. But they were different sort of eras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Lone Ranger&lt;/em&gt;, they were building the train line so people were just traveling across America and discovering this new World. There was a lot of open landscapes and a lot of America discovering itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;True Grit&lt;/em&gt;, the train line was already in. These towns were established, so it wasn&amp;#39;t this saloon swinging movie. It had an established town, it was built up, it was functioning, people had a purpose, people had jobs, people had responsibilities. It wasn&amp;#39;t the old Wild West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lone Ranger&lt;/em&gt; was like the Wild West of yesteryear. I fell like &lt;em&gt;True Grit&lt;/em&gt; was more of a modern day Western. I mean, it took place in Arkansas. Some people say it was an Eastern. We were also able to stylize it into a Coen Borthers way with some of the sets. Mixing the grocery in with all the produce and the meats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you prefer the big pulpy type of world-building like &lt;em&gt;The Lone Ranger&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;/em&gt;, or the more subtle stuff like &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; and *A Serious Man?&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s an equal challenge. Big movies come with big problems and small movies come with big problems. There are no small-problem movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really feel a movie like &lt;em&gt;Inside Llewyn Davis&lt;/em&gt; is so much harder to do than a &lt;em&gt;Lone Ranger&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;True Grit&lt;/em&gt;, because the camera is locked-off. It&amp;#39;s like looking at a photograph. The audience gets to examine. And I tried to avoid that, because I want them to look at the performance and I want my stuff just supporting that. But if somebody&amp;#39;s looking around, a movie like &lt;em&gt;Inside Llewyn Davis&lt;/em&gt;, which is very slow-paced with the camera locked off, just looking at the performances and singing performances, is much more of a challenge than doing a giant movie where you&amp;#39;re flying by things on horses, on trains, on cars. Those things are much more forgiving. Challenging in their own way – you have to do monstrous stuff – but I find the finer details stuff is much less forgiving as a production designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think an actor will say that too. If an actor is on a boat chase, they&amp;#39;ve got the wind and someone&amp;#39;s chasing them, and they&amp;#39;re acting above that, as opposed to citing Shakespeare on a stool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If someone said, &amp;quot;Okay Jess, we&amp;#39;re going to make the film you want to make.&amp;quot; Would you prefer a period-piece, something sci-fi, or what?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A period piece, really. I love the 50s and the 60s. It&amp;#39;s fun to do the period pieces. The futuristic things, I would love to get in there but it&amp;#39;s definitely more intimidating, because we don&amp;#39;t know what the future looks like. We can draw on the past and put our own twist on the past, so it&amp;#39;s definitely more comfortable to do things that have already happened. I sort of gravitate to that. But I would definitely like somebody to ask me to put my spin on what the future would look like too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary—look, as long as the script is great. To me, it&amp;#39;s all about the script. A movie like &lt;em&gt;Foxcatcher&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;#39;s an amazing script, my buddy&amp;#39;s directing it, he&amp;#39;s got a great cast, it&amp;#39;s 1980s and I think I ended up assigning a really good look to that movie, but it&amp;#39;s sort of contemporary. So you have to figure out how you&amp;#39;re going to make something like that look good. And I think it&amp;#39;s amazing. I think I did come up with some good concepts for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the contemporary things, as long as the script is good. But if there&amp;#39;s a good script in the Civil War, yeah, that&amp;#39;s a home run right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I noticed you were the Second Unit Director on Foxcatcher. Is that part of the career path or just a one-off?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I think it&amp;#39;s part of the career path. I don&amp;#39;t think I could ever stop doing production design, I love it. You&amp;#39;re the first person on the movie, besides the director. On a movie like &lt;em&gt;Hail, Caesar!,&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;ve got five months of prep, because that&amp;#39;s what it takes. On &lt;em&gt;The Lone Ranger&lt;/em&gt;, you get nine months of prep. So you&amp;#39;re with the script, you&amp;#39;re with the director, you&amp;#39;re with the environment, and they trust you to tell the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I actually said to (Bennett Miller): &amp;quot;Look, I know you have your hands full. If there&amp;#39;s anything I can help with and go shoot, I would love to do it.&amp;quot; He&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;Nobody knows the story better than you, Jess, and that would be fantastic. I would embrace that.&amp;quot; So no giant scenes with acting, but whatever I could do to do and fill in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get to this point on a movie, you get the material. You get it better than most people on the movie, just because you&amp;#39;ve been living with it for longer, having dialogue with the director for a long time. So yeah, I&amp;#39;d like to do more of that. Or directing on my own. We&amp;#39;ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not easy to do that and design a movie, but it was probably one of the most satisfying film experiences I&amp;#39;ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So do you look at someone like Robert Stromberg (director of Maleficent) as an inspiration? Because there aren&amp;#39;t that many directors who go through the avenue of a production designer into directing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Alfred Hitchcock. I mean that&amp;#39;s why his movies looked so good. He was an art director for a while, and his visual style is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, I&amp;#39;m friendly with Rob and thrilled to death with what he&amp;#39;s done. And &lt;em&gt;hell yeah&lt;/em&gt; I look up to him, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He came up the visual effects side though, and you&amp;#39;re doing more the classical route. Are more people coming in the visual effects side, now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, they are, because there&amp;#39;s a lot more movies like that. A lot of visual effects in movies, so people are crossing over who are artists and creating the worlds that some movies require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still think that it all starts with the script. Whatever your training, if you can understand the story you&amp;#39;re trying to tell and not just upstage everything with a background that looks good, then I think you can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My path was the theatre, I started in high school. I will credit forever that backstage crew that I with in high school, learning about what it takes to do something with absolutely nothing. Just a roll of duct tape and a couple of twigs.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Open Windows</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;My first thought when I saw your job title was: &amp;quot;Well, that sounds stupid—it must be a mistake.&amp;quot; Which was similar to the thought I had when I first heard the concept for &lt;em&gt;Open Windows&lt;/em&gt;. But after watching the film – and looking up the definition of &amp;quot;documentalist&amp;quot; – I can say that both things, sadly, actually exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Told completely through the point-of-view of a computer desktop, &lt;em&gt;Open Windows&lt;/em&gt; tries to combine the experience of multitasking (which people do when watching a bad movie) with, well, a bad movie. It would be amazingly meta, if only it wasn&amp;#39;t so stupid,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is notable for a few reasons: it&amp;#39;s yet another low-budget/high-concept thriller starring Elijah Wood, who can&amp;#39;t seem to get enough of these types of films lately; it also stars Sasha Grey, famous for her low-budget/low-concept/high-intensity porn. Both play to their strengths, Wood as wide-eyed, whiny geek, and Grey as a low-energy, emotionally detached rape victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all starts off promisingly enough, with plenty of visual possibilities, especially compared to restricted-premise films like &lt;em&gt;Buried&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/6/10/locke.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Locke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, we have the ability to navigate between screens/scenes at a ComiCon-type conference in a hotel, before twisting into an impossibly absurd game of cat and mouse. Or, more accurately, mouse and click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which bring us to you. Your job, by definition, is to search databases on behalf of other users. In other words, you operate similarly to the film&amp;#39;s mysterious villain, who keeps hacking into security cameras, cellphones, and other people&amp;#39;s accounts to give Wood&amp;#39;s fanboy character the perfect view of everything that&amp;#39;s happening to his beloved starlet. What this really meant for you on set, I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it was doing research to understand what type of 3D rendering is possible by syncing a bag full of webcams, then I&amp;#39;m afraid you failed miserably. In the film&amp;#39;s most &amp;quot;inventive&amp;quot; action sequence, the interpretation of events looks like a bad animation test for YTV&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;ReBoot&lt;/em&gt;. Or maybe you were doing more practical research: trying to find English voiceover actors for this Spanish production. Even bigger fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s really nothing to recommend here, other than you need a new job. And a new title.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Fury</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Day in and day out, surrounded by piles of animal viscera. The smell of decaying flesh, the convincing simulacra of human bodies subject to disfiguring misuse—it must have worn on you. Or at some point did you become indifferent to the mud-caked entrails? What was it like, knowing that your work spoke directly to the butchery humanity will engage in, often on the shallowest of pretenses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War often comes down to a very straightforward choice: kill or be killed. That dilemma, and whether or not a third option exists in an operational theater of war, is the preoccupation of your film, &lt;em&gt;Fury&lt;/em&gt;. Or as Brad Pitt&amp;#39;s character, Sgt. Don (Wardaddy) Collier opines: &amp;quot;Ideals are peaceful, history is violent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would imagine you must have had mixed feelings about this particular job. On one hand, the job of set decorator can be somewhat mundane. For instance, your work on KAVANAGH QC is mostly dull, British, middle-class interiors and bare wooden benches. Bit of a yawner, I would guess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fury&lt;/em&gt; appears anything but dull. How often is set decoration a fundamental component of a film&amp;#39;s aesthetic? Usually its value is in it melding seamlessly with the background. But your work was pivotal in setting a tone of bleak and relentless carnage. Everywhere the camera turned, there was a new vista of destroyed buildings, dead and looted animal corpses, and human beings crushed into paste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps your work on &lt;em&gt;Band of Brothers&lt;/em&gt; prepared you, but this piece is far more graphic. And it really is ever-present; except for one short interval, the whole 135-minute run time is backlit by your grisly landscape of total war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That relentlessness was obviously intentional, designed to give us a sense of what it might have been like to wade through the mire day after day. The whole film seems designed to create a pall of moral ambivalence. An ambivalence that seems the only possible way to survive the daily horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You did your job, Malcolm, no matter how unsettling or grotesque it may have seemed. &lt;em&gt;Fury&lt;/em&gt; is, in many ways, about how humans push through revulsion in order to perform a necessary task. The importance of overcoming the inherent human tendency to abhor violence and killing – not the fear of death but of taking another&amp;#39;s life – has always been an underexplored aspect of war films. Yet it has always been the most complex part of creating useful soldiers. It&amp;#39;s even more difficult to break the prohibition against killing than it is to suppress people&amp;#39;s fear of their own death. In this sense, &lt;em&gt;Fury&lt;/em&gt; is an effective study of how one man is broken down, incrementally, until he can operate efficiently in circumstances few of us could imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your filmis perhaps the most courageous English language production I have seen in its meticulous attention to the details of war. Never once did I feel the camera pull away simply because an image was unpalatable. Nor did it linger simply for prurient reasons. If the camera stayed fixed for a moment or two, it was only to give us a chance to absorb the profound wrongness of what we were seeing. That unflinching regard may cost this film the box office (and even some of the critical acclaim) it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some clumsy narrative construction, &lt;em&gt;Fury&lt;/em&gt; is a remarkable examination of the kind of moral quandary that otherwise good people must face when thrust into armed conflict. And while the story is told from an American point of view, it becomes clear, rather quickly, how little moral distance there is between soldiers when the shooting starts. Neither side escapes being dragged, both literally and metaphysically, through the mud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The honesty, courage, and effectiveness of those details are due, in part, to your dedication to authenticity, Malcolm. I wish I could applaud you for that. But the best I can do is recommend that people see for themselves why this film, and your work in it, is worth watching. Even if it wears heavily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tim McEown&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tusk</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be up front and say that if I hadn&amp;#39;t known beforehand that Johnny Depp would appear in &lt;em&gt;Tusk&lt;/em&gt; under a pseudonym – a &amp;quot;secret&amp;quot; that everybody and their grandmother seems to know by this point – I would never have recognized him. So you deserve some props for that. However, while he&amp;#39;s hidden beneath that brilliant makeup, Depp (or &amp;quot;Lapointe&amp;quot;) overacts to such a horrific degree that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost unbearable to watch. Which is indicative of the problem with &lt;em&gt;Tusk&lt;/em&gt; as a whole: it never seems sure what type of movie it&amp;#39;s trying to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take, for instance, a late-in-the-game flashback sequence in which his retired homicide detective recalls the time hefirst met the film&amp;#39;s villain, played by Michael Parks. I sat in my seat, utterly aghast, as the two actors stared awkwardly at each other, forcing out allegedly humorous dialogue (apparently faux-Quebecois accents are Kevin Smith&amp;#39;s idea of biting satire) in a bit that goes on for so long that the unspooling of quantum time ceases to retain any meeting. And then, all of a sudden, Lapointe returns to the present and somberly states that he was once missed an opportunity to save one of Parks&amp;#39; victims. I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll agree that there are talented filmmakers out there who can walk the line between humour and tragedy. Kevin Smith, sadly, doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;#39;t much of a surprise that &lt;em&gt;Tusk&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s biggest issue is how it treats it&amp;#39;s central character, Wallace Bryton of the Not-See Party podcast. [As an aside: did you ever stick around on the set once Depp&amp;#39;s makeup was applied, and, if so, did you notice Smith quietly chuckling to himself every time a character mistakes &amp;quot;Not-See Party&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;Nazi Party&amp;quot;? I feel like that would have made for a pretty unpleasant drinking game.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo...as soon as we meet Bryton, he&amp;#39;s already such a loud, crude, belligerent asshole (for lack of a better term) that it&amp;#39;s impossible sympathize when Parks abducts him and reveals his plans to surgically alter him into a man-walrus hybrid. To be fair, the initial reveal is by far the funniest moment of the film; the group I saw the film with was nearly in tears. And yet, we&amp;#39;re also supposed to empathize with Wallace, even though he&amp;#39;s the focus of a goofy sight-gag one second, then tearfully reflecting upon his lost humanity in the next. The wild tonal shifts are enough to give you whiplash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that point, the ludicrous design of Wallace the Walrus makes it abundantly clear that we&amp;#39;re supposed to be laughing &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; him; Smith never attempts to hide just how artificial the costume really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s odd that such a messy film would have a villain as compelling as Michael Parks. As goofy as the material is, he imbues the character with an interesting mix of madness and sadness, all slowly revealed as the reasons for his walrus-love become apparent. It&amp;#39;s captivating stuff, but given how scattershot the rest of the film is, it&amp;#39;s a safe assumption that this speaks more to Parks&amp;#39; strength as an actor than it does to the quality of the material he was working with &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t know how I could sell someone on this movie. It certainly doesn&amp;#39;t work as a horror movie. Or even a thriller. And yet, there&amp;#39;s really nothing funny about it. Here&amp;#39;s hoping that your actor-concealment skills are put to better use in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Citizen Marc</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;At one time or another everyone has wanted to be a superhero. Who hasn&amp;#39;t imagined what it would feel like to stand victorious, fist raised, cape flowing? There&amp;#39;s something honourable about battling evil, about wanting to make the world a better place. There&amp;#39;s also something distinctly adolescent about the idea. It appeals to our basest desires of wanting to be powerful and universally adored. But isn&amp;#39;t fighting a noble cause supposed to be a reward in itself? Isn&amp;#39;t that why, after the villain is vanquished, Bruce Wayne, Peter Parker, and Clark Kent don&amp;#39;t stick around waiting for the news vans to show up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently all the comic books that marijuana activist Marc Emery read as a kid were missing the last page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interspersed between numerous news clips and interviews in the documentary &lt;em&gt;Citizen Marc&lt;/em&gt;, your animations depict Emery as a bespectacled, chiseled superhero with a receding hairline, battling against the Big Bad Government of Canada—and anyone else who dares keep him from his goal of legalizing marijuana. The tone is perfectly balanced between mockery and begrudging admiration. After all, Emery may be a cartoonish megalomaniac, but he also may be right when he claims to have done more than anyone else to advance the marijuana movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Citizen Marc&lt;/em&gt;, instead of lionizing Emery, portrays him as a narcissistic mercenary. This is clear in his origin story: Emery&amp;#39;s love affair with the almighty dollar began as a pre-teen, when he started selling comics to friends, an endeavour that he tells us soon had him earning more than his father. At seventeen, Emery dropped out of school and bought the City Lights bookstore in London, Ontario, the site of what he calls &amp;quot;The Prophecy&amp;quot;. A woman fell in front of his store and had a vision of three symbols pertaining to him: a dollar sign, a spiky leaf, and a brain with a cage around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could only be more ridiculous if he was bitten by an infected spider. Oh yeah, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2011/07/17/18432866.html&quot;&gt;that happened too.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most superheroes, who are content to toil away in obscurity, Emery seems to get stronger with every self-aggrandizing publicity stunt. Sure he&amp;#39;s the Prince of Pot, but he&amp;#39;s also the King of Over-Sharing. It must have been difficult for you and the filmmakers to decide just which period of his life to animate. But you chose well. Against a black background, you outline our caped cannabis crusader in white with the initials M E on his chest, dropping green seeds over the world in his attempt to &amp;quot;overgrow the government.&amp;quot; You show this Ayn Rand-loving libertarian shoveling money into a fire as he buys his way into politics. You depict this sound-bite machine as a modern-day Moses, who inserts himself into religious imagery and bathes in cannabis oil (like Jesus, he claims), referring to his toker acolytes as &amp;quot;the chosen people.&amp;quot; Your simple black and white animation is the perfect juxtaposition for a man whose ideology is painted in broad strokes of grey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all superhero movies there are the innocent bystanders who watch helplessly as their city gets hijacked. &lt;em&gt;Citizen Marc&lt;/em&gt; shows us that it&amp;#39;s not the citizens themselves, but their movement that is being hijacked by Emery&amp;#39;s ego (which, one of his detractors observes, &amp;quot;is 40% of his body weight&amp;quot;). The narrator tells us, over your animation of Emery throwing fireballs at a sentient government building, that his capitalist views and anti-government message aligns him more closely with the Republican agenda. This plays rather strikingly against the footage of Gandhi and Martin Luther King—two masters of civil disobedience to whom Emery guilelessly compares himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know how superheroes get around; Superman is faster than a speeding bullet, Spiderman has his webs, and Batman has a flashy car. &lt;em&gt;Citizen Marc&lt;/em&gt; seems content to let The Prince of Pot hoist himself by his own petard.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>St. Vincent</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It must be fun to shape a character from scratch. When you design wearable cosmetic enhancements to help an actor define a specific role, you get to see your work literally come to life. Be it a knobby nose, a bulbous chin – or, in the case of Naomi Watts&amp;#39; Baltic hooker, a baby bump – your work informs a character&amp;#39;s backstory (and, in this instance, her future). When we see a pregnant woman, we instantly understand where her life is headed. Similarly, when we see Bill Murray playing a rumpled, boorish reprobate, we know it&amp;#39;s gonna be exactly what we expect. And in &lt;em&gt;St. Vincent&lt;/em&gt;, his trademark offbeat charm doesn&amp;#39;t disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vincent is a misanthropic, alcoholic war vet whose life of quiet decrepitude is disturbed by the arrival of his new next-door neighbours: the recently divorced Maggie and her lonely son Oliver. Maggie begrudgingly relies on Vincent to mind Oliver after school, unaware that the old man&amp;#39;s babysitting repertoire includes trips to the racetrack, boxing lessons, and visits from Daka, a pregnant prostitute with the requisite heart of gold. But when Vincent&amp;#39;s financial and emotional issues threaten his relationship with Oliver, he must come to terms with his untenable existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the film, your job requires you to create something incredibly convincing or something over-the-top and obvious. Daka&amp;#39;s fake tan, fake nails, fake eyelashes, along with Naomi Watts&amp;#39; very fake Eastern European accent, make her realistic baby belly stick out—and not necessarily in the way you intended. Perhaps first-time feature director and writer Theodore Melfi relies too heavily on clichéd cinematic shorthand instead of trusting his characters and their actions to move the story forward. The few relationships Vincent has – with Daka, his bookie, his bartender, and Maggie and Oliver – are all strained. Yet they never seem beyond repair. The tension, therefore, feels manufactured. Luckily, though much of the drama is telegraphed, the cast – particularly newcomer Jaeden Lieberher as Oliver – has enough chemistry to overcome the unexceptional script&amp;#39;s shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The materials used to create prosthetics haven&amp;#39;t changed much in the last few decades, so it&amp;#39;s technique that separates a layperson from an artist. &lt;em&gt;St. Vincent&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t try too hard to stand out in the reluctant father-figure genre (think &lt;em&gt;The Bad News Bears, Bad Santa&lt;/em&gt;, and, most notably, &lt;em&gt;About A Boy&lt;/em&gt;, from which St. Vincent cribs a lot, right down to the schoolyard bullies and the student assembly climax). Maybe because it knows it doesn&amp;#39;t have to. Bill Murray is that rare actor whose very presence is enough to convince the audience that what they&amp;#39;re about to see is a cut above the rest. When Vincent cracks his head open trying to chip some ice for a drink, Murray achieved that perfect balance of funny/pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You created a scab prosthetic for his forehead. It gradually heals over the course of the film, as Vincent, predictably, grows as a person. But with Murray the progression is never boring.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Left Behind</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t know this, but you shaped my childhood in a large way. My father is super into End Times Prophecy, and my family used to watch &lt;em&gt;This Week In Bible Prophecy&lt;/em&gt; (the show you co-hosted with your brother Peter), which disseminated how the weekly world news was actually fulfilling the prophecies of Revelation. My dad also read several of Tim LaHaye&amp;#39;s (co-author of the &lt;em&gt;Left Behind&lt;/em&gt; series of novels) &amp;quot;non-fiction&amp;quot; works, so I am well-versed on your theological stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m not here to debate that. I&amp;#39;m here to talk about your storytelling skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I came into this movie without ever having read the novels or seeing the first trilogy of films based on them. I had fresh eyes. I also tried &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard not to let my now-atheistic beliefs bias me against your film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the thing: despite the surprisingly competent – dare I say &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; - performances of the film&amp;#39;s stars, they really didn&amp;#39;t have much to work with. The only two things that really happen in the entire film are: 1) all the Christians and children suddenly disappear about halfway through, and 2) a plane almost crashes. That&amp;#39;s barely enough to sustain an episode of an hour-long television episode, let alone a 110-minute film (and I&amp;#39;m currently binge-watching the episodes of &lt;em&gt;Supernatural&lt;/em&gt; dealing with the Apocalypse, so I should know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religious beliefs aside, both the Rapture (an event which, strangely, is never referred to in the film as such) and the Apocalypse are fascinating stories that offer a lot of potential. It&amp;#39;s a shame you wasted them here. Maybe that&amp;#39;s the fault of Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins - like I said, I haven&amp;#39;t read the source material, so I don&amp;#39;t know what you were working with - but, as the co-writer AND the producer, you had the opportunity to do more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final aside: I know the producers make the final decision when it comes to the score, so you should know that it&amp;#39;s pretty shlocky at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Diane Carol Harder&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why Gone Girl Makes Me Sad for the State of Cinema</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Cinema,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You had a good run. Quite frankly, you changed the world. But in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;
 century, the world has changed you. Look no further than David Fincher&amp;#39;s latest film &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; for proof.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the canary in the cinematic coal mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; is a good film. &lt;a href=&quot;/content/2014/10/9/gone-girl.html&quot; title=&quot;Gone Girl review&quot;&gt;Almost a great film&lt;/a&gt;. It has a runtime of two and a half hours, but earns every minute – and then some. The story is juicy and complex, the performances are dialed in just right, and the plot twists are both frequent and fascinating. In any other era, &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; would have been worthy and welcomed in movie theaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; belongs on television. As a mini-series, where all great stories are told – unencumbered by the restraints of cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, restraints. Less than a generation ago, TV was widely considered a second-class medium. It was the domain of craftsmen instead of artists. A world filled with topical jokes and disposable drama. A place for censored stories and restrictive, sponsor-driven structures. Not to mention production limitations galore. Of course that&amp;#39;s no longer the case, as &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Boardwalk Empire&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;, and countless other TV programs have proved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new Golden Era of Television, the rulebook has been thrown out the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone heralds HBO as the game changer, but that channel is more poster child than messiah. Fantastic television mini-series have always existed (&lt;em&gt;Roots&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;North and South&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jesus of Nazareth&lt;/em&gt;), but today, the mini-series has become the gold standard for great storytelling. Turning to a mini-series for a rich, nuanced and ambitious story is no longer the exception, but the &lt;em&gt;expectation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;. A film whose scope, scale and stars are all better suited for a serialized TV format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Fincher should have known better. He&amp;#39;s one of the most exciting American directors working today, and a rare example of an auteur who doesn&amp;#39;t write his own screenplays. Fincher&amp;#39;s recently proven with &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; that he&amp;#39;s the perfect candidate for helming a mini-series, which makes his &amp;quot;step-backwards&amp;quot; into cinema all the more frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not read Gillian Flynn&amp;#39;s much-loved book, so this is certainly not one of those complaints about &amp;quot;how much better the book was&amp;quot;. Flynn did a fine job adapting the screenplay herself. How do I know this? Because by the film&amp;#39;s third act, I was craving more time with the characters, more detail about their relationships and more scope to the story. It could be &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; I didn&amp;#39;t read the book that I wanted to savour the story even more. And why I felt the weakness of film as a medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the delicately paced first act of &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;, the twists and turns almost start to feel rushed as the film gains momentum. Character turns become pulpy instead of relatable. There are moments of revelation that almost beg the audience to take a breather to reflect and engage in conversation, the way you can with a mini-series. Instead we barrel forward to the climax and a time-crunching denouement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me craves the discussion that a mini-series affords before everything is wrapped up and answered for us. How can I not? The past year alone has brought us &lt;em&gt;True Detective&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Honourable Woman&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Knick&lt;/em&gt;. Even a film like &lt;em&gt;Fargo&lt;/em&gt; – which is a clinic in economical storytelling – lead to a dreaded-but-surprisingly-incredible re-imagining of that story. And at no time did that story seem stretched out or watered down on the small screen – it felt completely at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t take this the wrong way, Cinema, but to be worthy of a mini-series today is a wonderful thing. It&amp;#39;s probably the best medium for entertainment we have right now, so you really need to go big, or we&amp;#39;ll go home. Of course, there would be no justification for &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; to go any bigger. Everything was already scaled perfectly for a network to take on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that delicious story…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You really can&amp;#39;t compare books and film. Think about it: it&amp;#39;s one thing for Michael Crichton to write about a park filled with dinosaurs, but it&amp;#39;s quite another to bring them to life in a way that&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/4/4/top-10-uncredited-heroes-of-jurassic-park.html&quot;&gt;still believable 20 years later.&lt;/a&gt; But the distinction between film and television is now almost non-existent. &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; proves that we live in an era where film can simply mean &amp;quot;less&amp;quot; than TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess when it comes to &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;, I wanted more than you can offer. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Gone Girl</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite his famous ego as an auteur, Orson Welles paid a great compliment to Gregg Toland by sharing a title card with the cinematographer on &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt;. This crossed my mind as I saw your name in the opening credits for David Fincher&amp;#39;s thriller &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl.&lt;/em&gt; Your name&amp;#39;s not on the screen alongside Fincher&amp;#39;s, but the placement is telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound designers, like you, are usually listed in the end credits — the end of the end credits, actually. Without going into the politics of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/5/9/neighbors.html&quot;&gt;movie credit hierarchy&lt;/a&gt;, I think it might be a bit of nod to the importance of your contribution that your name is listed so highly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; is directed by David Fincher — often referred to as one of the most stylistically baroque filmmakers working today. So you might expect a sound design to match. But Fincher&amp;#39;s come a long way since the days of &lt;em&gt;Alien 3, Seven&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;/em&gt;. He&amp;#39;s now one of Hollywood&amp;#39;s most consistently reliable directors for turning in smart, exquisitely crafted dramas (let&amp;#39;s all agree to overlook &lt;em&gt;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&lt;/em&gt;, shall we?) that know exactly when—and more importantly when &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;—to go over the top. Fittingly, your sound design here syncs up perfectly with this more understated approach. And thank God for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve grown increasingly tired with modern sound design where everything, diagetic or not, needs a sound effect. Everything. I don&amp;#39;t know exactly when this started, but I became acutely aware of it in the mid 90s, around the time foley artists decided cigarettes needed to make a burning sound whenever a character took a drag. Little did I know we were heading into an era where even filmmaking techniques—camera pans, fades edits—would have their own library of sound effects. So much for the invisible arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Fincher, a savant to film craft if there ever was one, is far too smart to fall for these trappings. By taking everything—your sound design included, Ren—down to their basic, least intrusive forms, Fincher creates a setting that feels natural even as events start to go, well, bananas. Gillian Flynn&amp;#39;s 2012 novel is well-known for some pretty out-there plot twists, and her script keeps the craziness in-tact. Fincher and all of his collaborators respond to this, toning everything else down. And it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfred Hitchcock famously said that tension was created when the audience knew more than the characters did. The camera, providing an omniscient point of view, could reveal details to us that the characters could not know. In &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl,&lt;/em&gt; Fincher and Flynn flip this premise on its head. Ben Affleck&amp;#39;s Nick Dunne returns home on his fifth wedding anniversary to find his wife Amy missing, and signs of a struggle in the house. After bringing in the authorities to investigate, Dunne quickly becomes the prime suspect. Did he do it or not? That&amp;#39;s the question that preoccupies much of &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-Hitchcock element here is that the one person who knows this answer for sure—Dunne—is both our point-of-entry to the story and an opaque mystery. Where something like &lt;em&gt;The Fugitive&lt;/em&gt; gets its righteous propulsion from our knowledge that Richard Kimble is innocent, &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; asks us to invest ourselves in someone who might very well be a murderer. Again, and against the odds, it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casting Affleck as Dunne may be the film&amp;#39;s greatest strength: Affleck brings just enough &amp;quot;how could this happen to a fun-loving guy like me?&amp;quot; entitlement that, along with the more tangible character faults of Dunne himself, make us want to question his every motive. That Rosamund Pike as Amy, the titular girl, represented almost entirely in flashbacks informed by her own diary entries gives us one more level of remove from Dunne — and one more reason not to trust him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s just part of what &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; has in store. As the film moves from its early procedural tone to something much more outlandish, it actually starts to feel like a combination of both the old and new Fincher, specifically a grafting together of &lt;em&gt;Zodiac&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Game&lt;/em&gt;. And as things get crazier—and lets face it, much of &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s second half is flat out ridiculous – your sound design goes along for the ride. I&amp;#39;m not saying you ever go full-out-Tony-Scott-sound-design crazy, but the sound definitely starts to become a bigger presence near the end. As it does this, though, the film itself shifts tone again, trading in claustrophobic thriller for something approaching black comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all subtle changes, mind you. The intentional shifts in the film&amp;#39;s style give us permission to enjoy &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; for the tawdry, insane narrative it is. That&amp;#39;s a tricky balancing act to pull off without turning into a parody, but everyone involved does just that.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Night Moves</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t think of a worse gig for someone like you than a Kelly Reichardt film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve seen her earlier work – notably &lt;em&gt;Wendy and Lucy&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Meek&amp;#39;s Cutoff&lt;/em&gt; (both starring Michelle Williams) – you&amp;#39;ve undoubtedly noticed the simultaneously essential and throwaway nature of mixing the location sound. In order to achieve her distinctive brand of neo-realism, Reichardt often forces the audience to strain to make out the mumbled dialogue hidden behind campfire crackles or desert winds. At other times, she will eschew dialogue completely for 15 minutes at a time and just let the simplest location sounds support her minimal aesthetics. This might have lead you to assume that &lt;em&gt;Night Moves&lt;/em&gt; would be either the easiest job of your life, or the hardest. But that wasn&amp;#39;t the case, was it? &lt;em&gt;Night Moves&lt;/em&gt; probably turned out to be just another job, the same way it turned out to be just another film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reichardt, a true American auteur, has decided to take a modest step towards the commercial center in this story about environmental activists plotting to destroy a hydro dam. The narrative, motivations, and dialogue, are all fairly clear and easy to follow. Her trademark wandering characters are in control for most of this film, and her technical approach follows suit. The lighting is sparse and natural, the camera is slow and distant, and your location sound is dialed back but ever-present. This time, however, Jeff Grace&amp;#39;s soundtrack is covering much more of the transitions and mood shifts. It all ends up feeling a little too conventional, especially after the bold impression she left with her last film, &lt;em&gt;Meek&amp;#39;s Cutoff&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, this is far from a standard thriller. Reichardt is once again exploring the relationship between people and nature, but in a much more aggressive and direct approach than in the past. Jesse Eisenberg, in the central role, gives a restrained and introspective performance, but his co-stars Dakota Fanning and Peter Saarsgard are allowed to play within a slightly wider and more relatable range. They can smile, be sarcastic and openly debate consequences rather than bottle them all up inside. Perhaps this is why their character arcs are more sympathetic than Eisenberg&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being said or heard that usually makes Reichardt&amp;#39;s films unique. After toiling in independent obscurity for years, it&amp;#39;s hard to blame her for trying to make something less challenging on the audience. Except easy is never as rewarding – not for a viewer, and not even for a crew member like you.&lt;/p&gt;
