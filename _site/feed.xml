				<title>As Above So Below</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll admit it was a bit disappointing to learn that, contrary to what the promotional materials told us, the bulk of action in your new film As Above, So Below took place not in the famous Paris catacombs, but rather a series of offshoot tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a set designer, it must come as a blow when you come onboard a project only to be told there will be no need for the liberal use of skulls as a decorative feature. Which, for this movie, feels especially like a missed opportunity. That said, like the oppressive stone labyrinth our protagonists find themselves trapped in, the whole film feels remarkably solid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get over the lack of skulls, one of As Above&amp;#39;s greatest strengths is the constant sense of unease and claustrophobia evoked by your sets; everything feels appropriately dark and cramped. Unlike past efforts like, say, The Cave, which was home to an underground system so spacious and well-lit there could have been a Starbucks tucked inside it. Also worth noting is the creepiness generated by the increasingly confusing geography of the tunnels as they begin looping back in on themselves—and even breaking all rational laws. The surviving leads are faced with the realization that the only way of reaching the surface is heading ever downwards.  It&amp;#39;s a pretty dynamite setting for a horror movie, and despite the lack of elaborate set decoration, it never feels cheap. You can definitely pat yourself on the back for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have to say that I was a bit surprised by how downplayed the actual horror elements are. It feels like a spiritual successor to Indiana Jones more than anything.  We get an opening scene establishing our heroine as a borderline lunatic willing to risk her life exploring a tomb set for demolition, then plenty o&amp;#39; cryptic riddle-solving as a documentarian films her team in their search for the Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone, an artifact of untold power in the field of alchemy. It&amp;#39;s a good setup, and combined with the likeable (though admittedly one-dimensional) characters, it&amp;#39;s just enough to keep our attention before the scary shenanigans get under way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know about you, but I appreciated that the filmmakers didn&amp;#39;t needlessly explain the nature of the threat facing our intrepid explorers. There is mention of past sins coming back to haunt them, and the possibility is raised that they are, in fact, traversing Hell—but other than this, there&amp;#39;s no needless exposition. In fact, the horror here is most effective when it’s at its quietest: childhood items inexplicably appearing in the depths, creepy calls on rotary telephones, half-glimpsed apparitions, etc.  Too bad that the final twenty minutes or so devolve into the worst attributes of a found footage film, with lots of confused running around and the sudden appearance of hooded weirdos.  This loses much of the goodwill the film earns—though at least you make up for it with a satisfyingly non-tragic ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing I&amp;#39;d like to mention, because I&amp;#39;m very curious as to what happened on the set during that particular bit where a certain someone gets trapped in a crevice and has a prolonged panic attack before it begins to cave-in.  It&amp;#39;s certainly uncomfortable to watch, but also very clearly lifted from The Descent.  Is this a case of cinematic plagiarism? Or perhaps an homage of some kind?  Whatever the case, it&amp;#39;s incredibly distracting for anyone who has seen both films. I’m curious to know what your thoughts are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I&amp;#39;d say this film belongs squarely in the realm of in-one-ear-out-the-other entertainment, but it&amp;#39;s certainly watchable, and you can definitely do worse when it comes to end of summer fare. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An Eye for Beauty</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bad sign when Canadian icon Denys Arcand has a new film at your festival and it&amp;#39;s a) not being talked about, and b) playing here after already having a theatrical run in Quebec. Considering this is only his second film since the Oscar-winning &lt;em&gt;The Barbarian Invasions&lt;/em&gt;, it seems crazy that Arcand has been relegated to an afterthought on the festival circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an idea why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Eye For Beauty&lt;/em&gt; covers many of the same themes that Arcand explored so well in &lt;em&gt;The Decline of the American Empire&lt;/em&gt; - young intellectuals sitting around tables and freely discussing their outlook on art and debauchery - only this time, he&amp;#39;s a generation removed from his subjects. It&amp;#39;s missing real insight on what young professionals experience today, and displays none of the energy or pathos from his earlier work. The film largely comes across as a loveless and detached effort, and apart from the stilted English-speaking scenes, where the actors struggle to find a natural rhythm, it&amp;#39;s not without some merit. But it&amp;#39;s a film that fits in the lower half of Arcand&amp;#39;s work, and one that reveals he may be less a great filmmaker than a filmmaker who has made a few great films. Though that&amp;#39;s the case for many auteurs – especially in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Foxcatcher</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Some films feel important from the very first frame. &lt;em&gt;Foxcatcher&lt;/em&gt;, with its dreamy slow motion historical footage, and sparse soundtrack, is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After winning best director at the Cannes Film Festival, Bennett Miller&amp;#39;s new film was an obvious choice for this year&amp;#39;s line-up. It doesn&amp;#39;t hurt that it packs some diverse star power with Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo and Steve Carrell. The story of Olympic gold medal wrestler Mark Schultz&amp;#39;s relationship with billionaire John du Pont gets a treatment closer to &lt;em&gt;Capote&lt;/em&gt; than _Moneyball _(Miller&amp;#39;s two other directorial efforts, also based on true stories). The film is less interested in giving us information than atmosphere, with cold colours and restrained dialogue.The only real flourish is Carrell&amp;#39;s elongated nose, but even that quickly feels of service to the bigger story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an accomplished film that&amp;#39;s worthy of the hype, but the buzz is more about meeting (fairly high) expectations than delivering a real showstopper.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mommy</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I love you for showcasing films like this.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get jealous because Xavier Dolan is only 25, and already has 5 feature films to his name (all of which have been at TIFF). It makes me question what I&amp;#39;ve been doing with my life so far, but at the same time, he also makes me incredibly proud to be Canadian.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dolan is brilliant because he does not try to imitate Hollywood, or try to tell traditional 3-act stories. Instead, he creates worlds that are slightly different than our own, then sets very real, three-dimensional characters within them to see what will happen.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can hardly wait to see what kind of work he&amp;#39;ll be doing in ten years&amp;#39; time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Diane Carol Harder&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Breakup Buddies</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I really didn&amp;#39;t know what to expect when I saw this Chinese buddy road trip movie on the TIFFF programming list. But, recovering from a recent break-up myself, I was game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see why the stars, Bo Huang and Zheng Xu, are such a big deal in China; they&amp;#39;re both pretty hilarious, and have good chemistry (first honed when they starred together in &lt;em&gt;Lost in Thailand&lt;/em&gt;). What could have been a run-of-the-mill buddy comedy had some interesting twists, and a parallel narrative structure to make the divorce that instigates the story all the more poignant in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only real complaint is that the subtitles were too fast; there’s so much witty banter, but I was only able to catch every second or third line. Some of the story beats relayed by onscreen text (emails, text messages, etc.) weren’t translated, either. Overall, though, I found myself laughing a lot more than I thought I would, and found myself enjoying this fresh and unexpected side of Chinese cinema. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also a soothing balm to my own broken heart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Diane Carol Harder&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Phoenix</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people probably roll their eyes when they hear about another Holocaust movie. Personally, I watch every single one I come across—but it&amp;#39;s definitely not new territory. Although &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; somehow makes it feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the Holocaust is the setup. The main character is a survivor of Auschwitz, and the film never lets us forget it. But that’s not really what the story is about. It&amp;#39;s about the recovery, the haunting, and the feelings of betrayal survivors were forced to deal with in the midst of their normal, everyday lives. All of which is masterfully handled, both in the performances and the cinematography. Heavy stuff, but I was definitely glad that I spent my Saturday morning at the theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Diane Carol Harder&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Red Army</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of Hot Docs - Toronto&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; world-renowned film festival - but it usually signals something special when you TIFF folks land a documentary premiere. And that&amp;#39;s exactly the case for Gabe Polsky&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Red Army&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a truly great sports film, and certainly the best hockey doc of all-time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polsky chronicles the Russian superstars who came to fame during the late 70s and found unstoppable dominance in the 80s. Through fantastically paced editing, striking graphical treatments, mounds of archival footage and new interviews with Vladislav Tretiak, Alexei Kasatonov and, most entertainingly, Vyacheslav Fetisov, we learn what it was really like to play for the Soviet Union&amp;#39;s powerhouse hockey club. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enlisted as actual soldiers and forced to live in barracks away from their families for 11 months a year, the film uses hockey as the perfect prism through which to examine Cold War culture. The story continues all the way to the first Russians playing in the NHL, but never stretches back far enough to even mention the &amp;#39;72 Summit Series, which Canadians believe to be the definitive international hockey showdown. Not the case. The film proves there&amp;#39;s a tonne more rich hockey history to be found in subsequent years, and that the &amp;#39;72 Summit was only one battle in a great sporting war.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Search</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Some things you just want to like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Search, Michael Hazanavicius’ follow up to his phenomenally successful &lt;em&gt;The Artist&lt;/em&gt;, must have had you salivating when you saw it on the calendar.Starring Bérénice Bejo, and Annette Bening, with a tremendous breakout performance by a young man (a child, really), named Maksim Emelyanov, &lt;em&gt;The Search&lt;/em&gt; has a multi-faceted storyline filled with the kind of war-torn pathos that send chills through the Oscar crowd while still retaining some indie cred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​I can imagine your disappointment then, when you first screened it. Despite rambling, often stilted performances from the two principal cast members, it has great cinematography and some remarkable visual storytelling that is then undercut by long-winded, hackneyed speechifying (from Bening particularly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A six dressed up as a nine is somehow more disappointing than just a six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tim&lt;/p&gt;
