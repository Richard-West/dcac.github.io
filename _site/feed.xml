				<title>Kahlil Gibran&#39;s The Prophet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of an animated feature based on &lt;em&gt;The Prophet&lt;/em&gt;, Kahlil Gibran&amp;#39;s collection of poetic essays, was enough to spark my curiosity while selecting my festival fare this year. Though a few lines and passages from the book have stayed with me over the years, I&amp;#39;m not really one for poetry. It doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;come alive&amp;#39; for me very easily. But today was the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part poetry reading, part art gallery tour, part Yo Yo Ma concert, the film compiles chapters from the book into animated segments, each rendered by different artists. All of this is framed around the central narrative of a young girl who befriends a poet and political prisoner. That said poet is voiced by Liam Neeson was, admittedly, another huge draw for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibran&amp;#39;s text leaps to life in vivid colour, and my concern of too many things being attempted at once was soon forgotten. I realized it was best to simply succumb to the film&amp;#39;s interweaving elements, absorb the richness of the imagery and sound, and process it all afterwards. Although the main narrative is initially weak compared to the individual segments, it builds into a thoroughly moving conclusion, leaving me, admittedly, a little teary-eyed as I emerged from the theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you happen to know who I need bribe to get Liam Neeson to come to my house and read me poetry, please, hook a girl up.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Second Chance</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Susanne Bier&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;A Second Chance&lt;/em&gt; was perhaps a bleak choice to kick off my TIFF 2014 selections, but it set the bar pretty high. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau plays a policeman who does something drastic and inadvisable when tragedy strikes at home. Though my viewing companion was desperate for even a few moments of levity, I was waiting for the film to veer off into overwrought melodrama which, thankfully, it didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any story centered upon the endangerment or harming of children elicits an intensely visceral response, with little room or patience for nuance. Care is taken to present the character&amp;#39;s actions while underscoring their vulnerabilities, commanding compassion from the viewer rather than revulsion. Full credit goes to Bier for the restraint and sensitivity with which she treats the subject and her characters.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An Eye for Beauty</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bad sign when Canadian icon Denys Arcand has a new film at your festival and it&amp;#39;s a) not being talked about, and b) playing here after already having a theatrical run in Quebec. Considering this is only his second film since the Oscar-winning &lt;em&gt;The Barbarian Invasions&lt;/em&gt;, it seems crazy that Arcand has been relegated to an afterthought on the festival circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an idea why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Eye For Beauty&lt;/em&gt; covers many of the same themes that Arcand explored so well in &lt;em&gt;The Decline of the American Empire&lt;/em&gt; - young intellectuals sitting around tables and freely discussing their outlook on art and debauchery - only this time, he&amp;#39;s a generation removed from his subjects. It&amp;#39;s missing real insight on what young professionals experience today, and displays none of the energy or pathos from his earlier work. The film largely comes across as a loveless and detached effort, and apart from the stilted English-speaking scenes, where the actors struggle to find a natural rhythm, it&amp;#39;s not without some merit. But it&amp;#39;s a film that fits in the lower half of Arcand&amp;#39;s work, and one that reveals he may be less a great filmmaker than a filmmaker who has made a few great films. Though that&amp;#39;s the case for many auteurs – especially in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Foxcatcher</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Some films feel important from the very first frame. &lt;em&gt;Foxcatcher&lt;/em&gt;, with its dreamy slow motion historical footage, and sparse soundtrack, is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After winning best director at the Cannes Film Festival, Bennett Miller&amp;#39;s new film was an obvious choice for this year&amp;#39;s line-up. It doesn&amp;#39;t hurt that it packs some diverse star power with Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo and Steve Carrell. The story of Olympic gold medal wrestler Mark Schultz&amp;#39;s relationship with billionaire John du Pont gets a treatment closer to &lt;em&gt;Capote&lt;/em&gt; than _Moneyball _(Miller&amp;#39;s two other directorial efforts, also based on true stories). The film is less interested in giving us information than atmosphere, with cold colours and restrained dialogue.The only real flourish is Carrell&amp;#39;s elongated nose, but even that quickly feels of service to the bigger story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an accomplished film that&amp;#39;s worthy of the hype, but the buzz is more about meeting (fairly high) expectations than delivering a real showstopper.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mommy</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I love you for showcasing films like this.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get jealous because Xavier Dolan is only 25, and already has 5 feature films to his name (all of which have been at TIFF). It makes me question what I&amp;#39;ve been doing with my life so far, but at the same time, he also makes me incredibly proud to be Canadian.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dolan is brilliant because he does not try to imitate Hollywood, or try to tell traditional 3-act stories. Instead, he creates worlds that are slightly different than our own, then sets very real, three-dimensional characters within them to see what will happen.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can hardly wait to see what kind of work he&amp;#39;ll be doing in ten years&amp;#39; time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Diane Carol Harder&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Breakup Buddies</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I really didn&amp;#39;t know what to expect when I saw this Chinese buddy road trip movie on the TIFFF programming list. But, recovering from a recent break-up myself, I was game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see why the stars, Bo Huang and Zheng Xu, are such a big deal in China; they&amp;#39;re both pretty hilarious, and have good chemistry (first honed when they starred together in &lt;em&gt;Lost in Thailand&lt;/em&gt;). What could have been a run-of-the-mill buddy comedy had some interesting twists, and a parallel narrative structure to make the divorce that instigates the story all the more poignant in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only real complaint is that the subtitles were too fast; there’s so much witty banter, but I was only able to catch every second or third line. Some of the story beats relayed by onscreen text (emails, text messages, etc.) weren’t translated, either. Overall, though, I found myself laughing a lot more than I thought I would, and found myself enjoying this fresh and unexpected side of Chinese cinema. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also a soothing balm to my own broken heart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Diane Carol Harder&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Phoenix</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people probably roll their eyes when they hear about another Holocaust movie. Personally, I watch every single one I come across—but it&amp;#39;s definitely not new territory. Although &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; somehow makes it feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the Holocaust is the setup. The main character is a survivor of Auschwitz, and the film never lets us forget it. But that’s not really what the story is about. It&amp;#39;s about the recovery, the haunting, and the feelings of betrayal survivors were forced to deal with in the midst of their normal, everyday lives. All of which is masterfully handled, both in the performances and the cinematography. Heavy stuff, but I was definitely glad that I spent my Saturday morning at the theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Diane Carol Harder&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Red Army</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of Hot Docs - Toronto&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; world-renowned film festival - but it usually signals something special when you TIFF folks land a documentary premiere. And that&amp;#39;s exactly the case for Gabe Polsky&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Red Army&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a truly great sports film, and certainly the best hockey doc of all-time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polsky chronicles the Russian superstars who came to fame during the late 70s and found unstoppable dominance in the 80s. Through fantastically paced editing, striking graphical treatments, mounds of archival footage and new interviews with Vladislav Tretiak, Alexei Kasatonov and, most entertainingly, Vyacheslav Fetisov, we learn what it was really like to play for the Soviet Union&amp;#39;s powerhouse hockey club. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enlisted as actual soldiers and forced to live in barracks away from their families for 11 months a year, the film uses hockey as the perfect prism through which to examine Cold War culture. The story continues all the way to the first Russians playing in the NHL, but never stretches back far enough to even mention the &amp;#39;72 Summit Series, which Canadians believe to be the definitive international hockey showdown. Not the case. The film proves there&amp;#39;s a tonne more rich hockey history to be found in subsequent years, and that the &amp;#39;72 Summit was only one battle in a great sporting war.&lt;/p&gt;
