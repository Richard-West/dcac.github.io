				<title>If I Stay</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Your name has become synonymous with the type of excellence that implies prestige, superiority and exclusivity. You are widely regarded as one of the foremost learning institutions providing education to the highest calibre of young performing artists from around the world. With an admissions acceptance rate hovering around 7%, it’s no wonder your audition process is notoriously intense. In books, television and movies, when a character is trying to get into Juilliard, it is shorthand for a person with slavish dedication and phenomenal talent. It’s unfortunate, then, that your name goes slumming in the mawkish teen weeper If I Stay, where it gets dragged through cloying, pedestrian sewage and drowns in sentimental cliches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck getting rid of that stink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mia is a cello phenom living in Portland with her ex-punk rocker parents and tow-headed little brother. Her moody boyfriend, Adam is a rising rock star who she hasn’t seen in weeks since their fight about you, Juilliard. See, if you accept Mia as a student, Adam won’t continue their relationship, because long-distance is just too hard for him. Instead of waiting at home in anticipation of an acceptance letter from you, she joins her family on a snowy car ride that turns tragic when they are struck by another vehicle. While in a coma, Mia has an out of body experience that gives her the power to decide whether she should live or die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could go back, I would have brought a bottle of Jack Daniels with me to the theatre to play the If I Stay Drinking Game. Had I taken a swig every time your name was mentioned, I would have been blissfully wasted by the end of the first act, saving me from another hour of maudlin inevitibility. The booze would have helped numb the repetitive stress that my eyeballs sustained every time I rolled them back in my head upon hearing faux-spirational lines like, “sometimes you make choices, sometimes choices make you”. Or when the middle-aged, African-American nurse, in full Magical Negro mode, whispers to the comatose Mia, “You control this, baby. Whatever you got left in you, pull it out now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On second thought, I should have brought chloroform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I Stay is told mainly in flashbacks; Mia’s parents raising her in dive bars, Mia’s parents settling down but never losing their punk edge despite their hippie-dippy parenting style, Mia and Adam falling in love. The story’s naivete is matched only by its dullness. Some of your former playwright students, Wendy Wasserman (The Heidi Chronicles), John Guare (Six Degrees of Separation), and Tony Kushner (Angels In America), employed flashbacks in fresh and thought-provoking ways, two qualities If I Stay’s comatose script (based on the novel by Gayle Forman) sorely needed. Chloe Grace Moretz, who plays Mia, showed early promise in Let Me In and Kick Ass, but fails to deliver here. She spends most of the movie with furrowed brow, forever on the verge of tantrum while running through hospital hallways. It’s a soap-operatic performance worthy of an after-school special. The saving grace, you might be happy to know, is that at least the soundtrack and score were exceptional. Or maybe they just stood out so much because they felt like they came from another, better film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that If I Stay was not targeted for my demographic; people over forty who like good movies. But when I was 14-years-old, one of my favourite films was, and still is, Running On Empty.  It shares similar themes with If I Stay, yet doesn’t wallow in hackneyed sentimentality. Directed by Sidney Lumet, it’s the story of a young piano prodigy who is constantly on the run with his fugitive, ex-hippie parents who are wanted for bombing a federal building to protest the Vietnam War. The teenage son, played by River Phoenix, must decide whether to keep running with his parents and brother, or attend Juilliard and risk never seeing them again. It’s a quietly complex character study masquerading as a coming of age movie, with politics, romance and nary a false note. The screenplay was nominated for an Oscar, as was River Phoenix for Best Supporting Actor, proof that it’s possible to make a movie about love, loyalty, and loss, for adults and teens, that condescend to neither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course none of this is your fault, but brand association is something you should be more concerned with. On the ride home from seeing If I Stay, I asked my 13-year-old niece if she even knows what Juilliard is. Her response? “Oh yeah, it was in one of the High School Musical movies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe you consider this a step up.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ghosts of Ghostbusters: Elmer Bernstein</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You learned a little something, over your long and storied career, about how to score comedy films. You came to it late, though. In the early 1980s, even though you were already one of the most famous film composers in the business, John Landis still had to fight with the studio brass to bring you onboard National Lampoon’s Animal House (sure, he was probably a fan—but he also grew up down the street from you and was pals with your kids). They didn’t think you could score a straight-up comedy flick. And, boy, did you prove them wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You followed up Animal House with a run of comedy scores that can only be described as legendary: Meatballs, Airplane!, The Blues Brothers, Stripes, and Trading Places (for which you were nominated for an Academy Award). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoring a comedy film is less about themes and melodies than it is about tone—and tone, in comedy, is a precarious thing. Which is ,why the music you composed for Ghostbusters is so brilliant. Classical orchestral elements mixed with wavering Theremin notes and a bit of synth, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ghostbusters soundtrack is so preeminent that your score is often forgotten. Play Ray Parker’s Jr.’s eponymous theme song (or Huey Lewis’ “I Want a New Drug,” for that matter), and, even without the lyrics, it’s instantly recognizable. Play the main theme from your score, however, and I wonder how many people – though it would seem familiar to them – would identify the melody with the world’s most famous team of paranormal investigators. But that jaunty piano march is the perfect balance to the pop music that proliferates throughout the rest of the film. More than the cinematography, more than the directing, more than the performances, it’s the regulating element that prevents the special effects and supernatural mythology from overwhelming the film’s &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghostbusters, at its heart, is a small film, filled with wonderful small moments that are more than the sum of their parts. And it was your score that gave them room to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ghosts of Ghostbusters: Harold Ramis</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You’re in the bottom half of the Ghostbusters hierarchy. Murray and Ackroyd are the names and faces everyone remembers—Murray for his half-there, in-on-the-joke performance as Peter Venkman; Ackroyd for his weird real-life parallelism with his supernatural conspiracy-theorist character Ray Stanz. But that was the place you seemed most comfortable; to operate quietly at the periphery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the entire generation of kids born in the late 70s and early 80s, Ghostbusters was a seminal cultural product for me: I wore out my Betamax copy of the movie, watched the Saturday morning cartoon religiously, and collected the toys (the one action figure that I owned: Egon Spengler [with Gulper Ghost]). But I came to appreciate your contribution to the film primarily through your other work; most notably the early years of SCTV. You started out in front of the camera, and while you created a handful of memorable characters (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYCbF0Fat-c&quot;&gt;Moe Green&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BftMylPpChw&quot;&gt;Curtis Edgit: Plainclothes Mountie&lt;/a&gt;), it was clear that your true talents lay elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generosity of spirit to bring out the best in others is an underrated virtue—especially in a place like Hollywood. While Murray and Ackroyd and Reitman get much of the credit, the simple fact is: there would be no Ghostbusters without you. And it’s not because your performance as Egon is singular, and not necessarily because of what you contributed to the screenplay. It’s because your presence allowed those around you to flourish. It was true back in the Toronto studios of SCTV, and, if your legion of grateful collaborators are to be believed, true on the set of every film you worked on.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ghosts of Ghostbusters: David E. Blewitt</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What a weird movie this must have been to edit. &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters _had so many disparate elements to balance. There&amp;#39;s the shambling, semi-improvised comedy in the style of _Caddyshack, Stripes&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Meatballs&lt;/em&gt; that requires a light touch to get the pacing just right. Then there&amp;#39;s the high-budget special effects extravaganza that forces itself into the comedy, requiring beats more akin to an action movie. And speaking of beats, there&amp;#39;s also the seemingly random soundtrack that mixes all manner of song genres, with each song requiring a moment in the spotlight with its own mini-montage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, David, you were the perfect man for the job. With your career experience, mainly in documentary filmmaking, you were certainly qualified to filter through and stitch together what--based on the players involved--must have been a mountain of footage. Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis certainly didn&amp;#39;t need your help to be funny. No doubt they were thankful to have your expertise in choosing which improvised bits were not only funniest, but best served the story. And maybe because _Ghostbusters _was a new kind of cinematic beast at the time, you chose the most straight-ahead stylistic approach. Comedy, effects and action are all treated with a similar documentary-like feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; director of photography Laszlo Kovacs also had extensive documentary experience, and together you gave the film exactly what it needed. The almost detached point of view that lets the growing insanity feel that much more, well, _insane _against the backdrop of  very real 1980s New York City. That&amp;#39;s what made the ghosts both funny and scary; we were never told exactly what to feel, and could therefore feel anything we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ghosts of Ghostbusters: Chuck Gaspar</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the eggs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eggs make me most appreciate your work on &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters.&lt;/em&gt; As special effects supervisor, you were responsible for all of the practical, on-set effects work. The really big set-pieces—proton packs, Slimer, Terror Dogs, Gozer, Stay Puft Marshmallow man, and so on—those were the domain of Richard Edlund, and his visual effects team. Your team had the task of making all of those post-production elements feel real, and appear to interact with the real on-set elements. Chandeliers exploding after a missed shot, a dining cart smashed into a wall by a frantic ghost; that was all you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I keep coming back to those eggs on the counter of Dana Barrett&amp;#39;s Upper West Side Apartment. It&amp;#39;s certainly not the most spectacular effect you rigged in &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters,&lt;/em&gt; but when revisiting the film after all these years, I was struck by how well that simple trick works. The eggs come alive, vibrating in their carton, jumping out, smashing on the counter and frying sunny-side-up. Apart from the logistics necessary to execute even this simple scene (was there a whole griddle rigged to that counter top?), I started contemplating how this would be created today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the entire sequence would be CGI. A graphic artist would spend hours creating wire frame models, adding texture maps, creating photorealistic eggs that could be manipulated in any manner. Sure, those eggs would really be able to really fly out of that carton, and the lighting on them would be perfect for any angle you could conceive of: the camera could be anywhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But none of it would have half the whimsy of the simple effect you created in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ghosts of Ghostbusters: Jim Bullock</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I could be in another room, on another floor, in another &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt; while &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; is on, and even if I only hear ten seconds, I know exactly what&amp;#39;s happening. Maybe that&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;ve seen the film at least a hundred times. Or maybe it&amp;#39;s because you transformed what must have been a thousand hours of audio tracks into the soundscape that helped make &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; one of the most beloved films of the last thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the very first scene your work sets the literal and figurative tone for the entire film; the librarian softly pads between rows of books over a seemingly benign score. The wood cabinet drawers slide open and catalogue files shuffle into the air. Then horns, a xylophone, and a Theremin amplify the tension as the librarian realizes she is not alone. Her footsteps quicken to a run, the score builds to a crescendo and we hear a deep, other-worldly roar pierced through by her blood-curdling scream that fades into Ray Parker Jr.&amp;#39;s titular song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were responsible for assembling layers of sound that have now become iconic; from the eggs rattling in their carton, then popping and frying on Dana&amp;#39;s kitchen counter; the green blob cackling and gulping and breaking plates; the _whoosh _as ghosts are incarcerated in the vapour trap. The assorted beeps, pulses, and hums of equipment, the deep growls of ghost hounds, and the splitting crack as the heavens open up and threaten to rain hellfire down on New York city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this noise, and yet you made sure the cacophony never drowned out some of the most quotable dialogue in comedy history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time you came to &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;, you were already an expert, having spent the 50s and 60s as sound editor on dozens of shows: &lt;em&gt;I Love Lucy, Peter Gunn, _and even one with a ghost protagonist, _My Mother the Car. _You tried your hand at acting in the 80s, appearing in _Knight Rider, The Wonder Years,&lt;/em&gt; and my favourite bad movie, &lt;em&gt;Rocky IV&lt;/em&gt;. Those gigs alone are enough to make my inner child geek-out. Add &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;, and I think you just might be my new hero.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ghosts of Ghostbusters: Bernie Brillstein</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I knew who you were even before &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;. Which, considering I was eleven years-old at the time, either says a lot about your reputation, or says a lot about what an odd kid I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d seen your name on the credits of &lt;em&gt;Hee-Haw, The Muppet Show&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;. I read that you became John Belushi&amp;#39;s manager by accident when he refused to sign his SNL contract minutes before the first show went to air. He would commit only if &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, Lorne Michaels&amp;#39; manager, represented him. You agreed, and Belushi became your first star client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You broke a lot of ground in the late-70s and early-80s. You convinced Atlantic Records to pony up a hundred-and-twenty-five grand to produce an album by the as-yet-unknown Blues Brothers&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; You were one of the first to profit from packaging TV shows, hiring your own writers to create projects, then filling them with your own stars, and executive producing the programs yourself. After selling them to networks, this scheme guaranteed you a producing credit and points on the back end. Until you gamed the system, an exec producer was largely a figurehead. But, by packaging talent, you held all the cards. It&amp;#39;s a tactic that has since become the industry standard, and one you carried on into the 1990s with shows like &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos, Politically Incorrect&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Larry Sanders Show.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might consider that approach a little too close to bribery. But no one seemed to mind it coming from you. By all accounts you were a real mensch. While you were busy reinventing the wheel and trying to keep Belushi from killing himself, Dan Aykroyd had been developing a script for him and Belushi to star in. It was set in a future, where teams of ghost disposal units were as common as firefighters and paramedics. He called it &lt;em&gt;Ghost Smashers.&lt;/em&gt; After Belushi&amp;#39;s passing, Aykroyd and Harold Ramis reworked the script, and Aykroyd pitched it to you. As a testament to just how trusted you were, Aykroyd sold it to you for a dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After it was passed over by several studios and directors who just didn&amp;#39;t get it, the film, retitled &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;, went on to make over $291 million worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your dollar investment paid off. But more than that, it made you the original gatekeeper of Zuul.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ghosts of Ghostbusters: László Kovács</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You were certainly an unfunny choice for this movie. But with a motley cast, a motley crew, and a motley group of characters out to save the world, why not hire the cinematographer from &lt;em&gt;Easy Rider&lt;/em&gt; and_ Five Easy Pieces?_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both you and director Ivan Reitman have talked about how comedies typically have a look--and how this movie should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have that look. Instead of a simplistic comedy approach with high-key shots and bright colors, _Ghostbusters _is shot like a serious film. You added a distinct color cast, but otherwise let the scene define the tone (rather than imposing yourself on it). There are sequences that look like drama, documentary newcasts, and epic adventure (that 2.35:1 anamorphic aspect ratio!). This allows you to set real stakes in a plot that is patently ridiculous. It also allows for a very broad range of humor: from pun-tastic setpieces and light improv to dark sarcasm and tragic irony--all within the same film. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a consistently (and I imagine painstakingly) unobtrusive filmmaking approach, you allowed the movie to conjure it&amp;#39;s own reality. By making a comedy that didn&amp;#39;t look like a comedy, you made people believe this unbelievable story. I think that&amp;#39;s a key reason it&amp;#39;s stood up so well - and even improved - over all these years.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ghosts of Ghostbusters: Theoni V. Aldredge</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For a designer who won praise and awards for musicals and costume dramas, I find it weird and wonderful that you worked on &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result, which contrasts your usual golden gowns and flawless tuxes, lacks none of the detail. It&amp;#39;s pure understated geek cred, which serves the movie perfectly. Those earth-tone button-downs, pullovers, blazers, and khakis each member of the professional paranormal investigations and eliminations outfit perfectly. The clothes emphasize that our heroes are nobodies--a gang of misfits and losers who luck into a profitable business, and, eventually, a chance to save the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a movie made in 1984, this one has aged so very well. The only people who dress in embarrassing 80s style are those who are supposed to be completely embarrassing. The best example is Lewis Tully, aka. Vice Clortho, aka. The Keymaster of Gozer (aka. Rick Moranis). He&amp;#39;s all about velour tracksuits and turtlenecks beneath shiny collared shirts. So he probably deserves everything that happens to him. The real costume showcase, however, is Dana Barrett; as the central party of interest - and exponentially classier than everyone else - you made her look the part of the self-reliant damsel in distress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your work in &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; could have all been done yesterday, ten years ago, or ten years from now. Like the movie itself., this shit will never get old. Thank you for helping make it so.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ghosts of Ghostbusters: John De Cuir</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It seems strange and wonderful that you ended your illustrious Oscar-winning career with &lt;em&gt;Ghostbuster&lt;/em&gt;s. At 66 years-old, you were a Hollywood stalwart known for designing everything from Technicolor costume dramas like &lt;em&gt;The King and I&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;South Pacific&lt;/em&gt;, to iconic black-and-white film noirs like &lt;em&gt;The Naked City&lt;/em&gt;. But in your final two films, &lt;em&gt;Dead Men Don&amp;#39;t Wear Plaid&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;, you turned your talents to parody. Yet you still took your work dead serious. And by doing so, elevated what could have been mere supernatural silliness to something superb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your standout effort has to be the iconic ghost-busting HQ in the barely-renovated Hook &amp;amp; Ladder 8 fire station in Tribeca. You went all-out, layering cobwebs and dust before converting it all into a sparsely furnished frat-boy fantasy of pole-sliding fun. The doors still squeaked and the beds were foldout cots, but the money went where it mattered: into an ectoplasmic storage containment facility that&amp;#39;s the science-geek equivalent of a killer sound system. Of course, when the neighbour down the street (aka. the Environmental Assessment Agency) orders them to turn it off, all hell breaks loose. And so do your designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mix of matte paintings and early computer graphics turn the corner suite of a skyscraping apartment into a still-impressive paranormal beacon for the dead. The influence of &lt;em&gt;Raiders of the Lost Ark&lt;/em&gt; is perhaps obvious, but that doesn&amp;#39;t detract from the fun. You must have known that the jokes would work best as relief from the tension, and so created some genuinely impressive modern gothic statues and architecture that made the menace of Zuul feel real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not ashamed to say it: I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; afraid of those ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;
