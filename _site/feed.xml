				<title>The Price We Pay‎</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Documentaries about corporations and the bad things they do always seem to be a popular choice with festival audiences, including this former Poli-Sci major (who, admittedly, napped through most of second-year International Political Economy). Harold Crooks&amp;#39; &lt;em&gt;The Price We Pay&lt;/em&gt; tackles the issue of corporate tax avoidance and offshore tax havens. While a decent primer on the subject, I found the film got carried away with spotlighting corporate bad guys and neglected to answer some key questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid relying too heavily on talking heads, Crooks incorporates footage from UK parliamentary commissions and hearings with various executives from companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon. The British MPs emerge as the stars of the production. Their feisty, acerbic take-downs of the suits in the hot seat approaches near fervor at times, giving the audience plenty to boo and hiss about. Enjoyable as that was, Crooks drops the ball when it comes to making the case for the link between corporate tax avoidance and an increasingly heavy tax burden on the public. I accept the thesis, but I would have liked to see some more numbers to back it up. You can&amp;#39;t call your film &lt;em&gt;The Price We Pay&lt;/em&gt; without telling me what that price actually is.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Connection‎</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I usually avoid your Gala Presentations line-up. It&amp;#39;s stellar programming, but I know I&amp;#39;ll eventually get to see most of those films in theatres, and I&amp;#39;d rather save my money for selections I&amp;#39;ll probably never get another chance to see. I made an exception for Cédric Jimenez&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Connection&lt;/em&gt;, the French remake of &lt;em&gt;The French Connection&lt;/em&gt;, and I&amp;#39;m kicking myself for not attending the actual premiere. Stargazing isn&amp;#39;t really my cup of tea, but I&amp;#39;d watch Jean Dujardin shell pistachios in silence for two hours and still consider it the most compelling thing I&amp;#39;d seen all year. Seriously, the man might have the most hard-working eyebrows in contemporary cinema. They are a supporting role unto themselves. So, just this once, I may not have minded the shrieking throngs on the red carpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dujardin and Gilles Lellouche both deliver excellent performances as, respectively, a powerful drug lord and the magistrate appointed to go after him. Set in 1970s Marseille, the film is slick and stylish on all fronts (questionable sideburns on all male actors notwithstanding), with a killer soundtrack and an gripping plot that garnered some of the most enthusiastic audience response I witnessed at the festival this year&amp;#39;s festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. I have but one complaint; the most memorable part of the original &lt;em&gt;French Connection&lt;/em&gt; was the chase sequence. You know the one. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; chase sequence. Jimenez passes on recreating or refashioning the sequence in his version, and after waiting for it on tenterhooks, I felt a bit let down.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tu dors Nicole‎</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A dead-pan comedy from Quebec? I never thought I&amp;#39;d see the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having programmed so many films from La Belle Province over the years, you know Quebeckers tend to like their humour a little… broad. Big comedy franchises like &lt;em&gt;Les Boys&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Elvis Gratton&lt;/em&gt; are obvious examples, as are the annual &lt;em&gt;Bye Bye&lt;/em&gt; New Year broadcasts, and omnipresent &lt;em&gt;Just For Laughs&lt;/em&gt; television specials. It seems like an inordinate amount of Quebec humour comes from banana peels. Then someone like Stéphane Lafleur comes along and breaks all the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tu dors Nicole&lt;/em&gt; is framed and paced like a socially detached black-and-white art-house film following the circuitous summer days of two small town girls. But hints of surrealism tip off the audience to the comic absurdity. This feels like the first Echo X film, but made for a generation who is still too young to have found its own voice. Although this is pretty a darn good start.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>99 Homes</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Your line-up this year might have some problems, but &lt;em&gt;99 Homes&lt;/em&gt; ain&amp;#39;t one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writer/director Ramin Bahari steps out of indie obscurity to create a pointed and poignant look at the U.S. housing crash. Andrew Garfield and Michael Shannon face-off in this realistic drama about how the rich get richer, and the poor get fucked. Small details, like Garfield&amp;#39;s overgrown hair and Shannon&amp;#39;s smart (but not slick) manipulating ground the film rather than making it feel like it&amp;#39;s simply capitalizing on a cautionary tale du jour. It&amp;#39;s this year&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Margin Call&lt;/em&gt;, but with a better chance at breaking through to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;99 Homes&lt;/em&gt; is essentially a horror film for home-owners. Only the ghosts are real, and they come knocking on your door with foreclosure orders.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Imitation Game‎</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This is The Important British film with a capital WWII that everyone at the festival has been waiting for. And wow, it delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of mathematician/code-cracking genius Alan Turing was Oscar-bait the moment it was conceived as a screenplay. But what&amp;#39;s amazing is how well everything is actually handled. The non-chronological structure helps to not only keep the pacing strong, the plot twists engaging, and the character turns more dynamic, but also ensures that the climax is properly chilling without a sagging denouement. It&amp;#39;s an exceptional story told exceptionally well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cast is also in fine form, even if &lt;em&gt;Sherlock&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; Benedict Cumberbatch was the too-obvious choice to play another brilliant, socially awkward techno wiz. Consider it his redemption for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/10/22/the-fifth-estate.html&quot;&gt;another similar role&lt;/a&gt; in a film that opened your fest last year. This time, he&amp;#39;s given real heart and a full character arc, which finds a great dramatic ally in the film&amp;#39;s already monumental historical stakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If enough people see the film, it&amp;#39;s easily the most obvious (and maybe appropriate) choice for winning this year&amp;#39;s famous Audience Award.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Good Kill</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Good actors. Good script. Good director. Good timing. Good job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Kill&lt;/em&gt; is the kind of film that slides nicely into your programming. Though there&amp;#39;s some anticipation in seeing Ethan Hawk reteam with writer/director Andrew Niccol, any expectations are tempered by the fact both men have made some less than stellar projects since &lt;em&gt;Gattaca&lt;/em&gt; (the Ford Mustang that Hawk&amp;#39;s character drives throughout this film was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/9/4/getaway.html&quot;&gt;good reminder of that&lt;/a&gt;). Yet the story of a U.S. drone pilot feels rich for commentary, and Niccol doesn&amp;#39;t waste the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of delivering an over-written thriller, Niccol is more interested in exploring the malaise and disconnect between drone pilots and their targets. He creates some nice visual parallels between the battlefields of Afghanistan and the dusty Nevada base of operations that lies just outside the wild nightlife of Vegas. All the best lines go to Bruce Greenwood as the commanding officer, who rattles off catchy acronyms and golden military nuggets (like &amp;quot;get your revenge in first.&amp;quot;). But it&amp;#39;s the lines like &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t ask me if this is a just war. To us, it&amp;#39;s just war,&amp;quot; that give the film a conscience and prove the script isn&amp;#39;t operating on autopilot.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>TIFF 2014: Day Eight</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Our postcard dispatches form the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival for Thursday, September 11.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Captive</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have one big question for you: was the use of flashbacks and flash-forwards in &lt;em&gt;The Captive&lt;/em&gt; your idea? Or was it director Atom Egoyan&amp;#39;s? I&amp;#39;m curious to know whether this was part of the screenplay&amp;#39;s original structure, or if it was a choice made during post-production, mainly because it seems to be the most divisive aspect of the film. I can&amp;#39;t decide how I feel about it, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that telling the story this way forced me to think a little harder about what I was watching. This is not a criticism in and of itself, except that I&amp;#39;m not sure it was always necessary. Sometimes the temporal shifts felt like &amp;quot;a gimmick, a trick you didn&amp;#39;t need&amp;quot; (like Ryan Reynolds and his young daughter so aptly discuss during the scene right before she disappears).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there&amp;#39;s also serious confusion surrounding important plot points and when they actually take place. &lt;em&gt;(SPOILER ALERT!)&lt;/em&gt; It takes a long time, for instance, to reveal &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; Nicole, the detective played by Rosario Dawson, was actually kidnapped. This is the focus of the first scene of the film, but only actually happens last, chronologically - and this reveal feels anticlimactic after all the tension of trying to place it within the correct sequence of events, especially since it&amp;#39;s only a subplot to Cassandra&amp;#39;s disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, after I&amp;#39;d finished the film, when I really thought about it, this story device reminded me of the way my mind works when I obsess about something, thinking about it to the point of being overwhelmed, jumping from detail to memory to detail in no specific order while trying to figure out why something bad happened, something over which I ultimately had no control. So if that&amp;#39;s the feeling you were going for - a feeling of tense, OCD-like worry - then kudos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I enjoyed the film, but can&amp;#39;t quite figure out how I feel about this method of storytelling. Was it a gimmick you didn&amp;#39;t need, or a great trick for helping us empathize with the characters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Diane Carol Harder&lt;/p&gt;
