				<title>Revenge of the Green Dragons</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s official. You just screened my first major disappointment of the festival: &lt;em&gt;Revenge of the Green Dragons&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was pretty hard not to come into this Martin Scorsese-produced Chinese gangster film with high hopes – especially since it’s co-directed by Wai-keung Lau (credited as Andrew Lau), who made the Infernal Affairs films that Scorsese adapted into &lt;em&gt;The Departed&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it all goes terribly, almost hilariously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Set in 1980s New York, the film is full of English-as-a-second-language performances (or characters?), which lends itself to painfully on-the-nose dialogue and over-acting. And those are the forgivable sins. 
What makes the film slide straight into parody is the misguided attempts to make it feel like an 80s action movie; wailing guitar solo soundtrack, constant pace-killing fades to black, and strobing, slow-motion sequences meant to punctuate melodramatic deaths. Even the bang-bang intro feels like it comes from an 80s TV show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you’d think that’s the point, right? Except the film takes itself deadly serious. All the visuals are desperately trying to live in the shaky-cam, off-kilter camera angle universe of the present, and end up making the whole movie laughable when I was primed to love it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Elephant Song</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You never really know which films are going to draw a crowd at this festival. I figured I was safe only showing up a few minutes early for a Canadian film by Charles Binamé that’s adapted from a play. But of course, this one features filmmaking wunderkind Xavier Dolan in a starring role. So I had to sit on the theatre floor for about 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the first walk-outs left empty seats behind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, walkouts at press and industry screenings don’t mean much when you’ve crammed an unreasonable number of films into the line-up. Still, a high walkout rate never bodes well. I won’t venture to say how many left (not many more than normal), but as someone who stayed, I wasn’t all too riveted to my seat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dolan plays a mental patient who holds the secret to a doctor’s disappearance, but he never truly inhabits the character. His mannered affections came off as a Christoph Waltz imitation, and the story itself loses a lot of energy by the mid-point. Binamé knows how to move a camera in tight spaces to off-set staged exchanges, but when the mind-games grow wary, there’s little else to latch onto. 
Other than those comfortable arm rests I finally had.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Riot Club</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hot British bad boys certainly have (maybe not-so-niche) appeal. Even I was curious what female director Lone Scherfig would bring to &lt;em&gt;The Riot Club&lt;/em&gt;, which Laura Wade adapted from her own male-centric play, &lt;em&gt;Posh&lt;/em&gt;. And after the opening scene, which dives head-first into big breasts and unrepentant Renaissance debauchery through a wily sense of humour, I buckled up for a wild ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too bad the film never really went there. Despite this early filmic treatment and &lt;em&gt;Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;-esque promise, the film doesn’t amount to much more than &lt;em&gt;The Skulls&lt;/em&gt; at Oxford. The play’s spatial limitation start to feel unnecessarily confined for the big screen during the climax (especially in the massive Princess of Whales Theatre, which signalled a certain importance for a press-only screening). But alas, it was all ultimately as disposable as the women the male characters talk about but rarely engage. To re-quote the them, I suppose there are films for today, and films for tomorrow. This was just a film for today.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>TIFF 2014: Day Three</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Our postcard dispatches form the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival for Saturday, September 6.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>St. Vincent</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Bill Murray has a few &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/writers/coryh/&quot;&gt;big fans&lt;/a&gt; at Dear Cast and Crew. Just last week, we had a 10-review marathon series &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/8/22/ghosts-of-ghostbusters.html&quot;&gt;dedicated to Ghostbusters&lt;/a&gt;. But today, you guys and the City of Toronto one-upped us by declaring it Bill Murray Day, screening some of his classic films and culminating in the premiere of &lt;em&gt;St. Vincent&lt;/em&gt;. All this saintly canonizing was all just a warm-up, it seems, to preparing us for the film itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;St. Vincent&lt;/em&gt; follows a familiar story between a doe-eyed boy and curmudgeon old man (like &lt;em&gt;Bad Santa, Bad Grandpa, Denis the Menace&lt;/em&gt;, etc). But it’s hard to fault a film that had me laughing multiple times before the opening credits were done. It was smart for the festival to capitalize on this assured debut by writer/director Theordore Melfi, who leverages Murray’s natural appeal without letting him rest on the usual charms—and it just might earn the comedy legend some Oscar love. The film itself doesn’t elevate much past the feel-good material, but remains enjoyable throughout due to a strong supporting cast in Naomi Watts, Melissa McCarthy and Chris O’Dowd (not to mention delightful newcomer Jaeden Lieberher).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, it’s really all about Murray. As it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Goodbye to Language 3D</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re gonna play a new Jean-Luc Godard film, darn tootin&amp;#39; I&amp;#39;m gonna sit through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 83, The master French provocateur has not slowed down nor sanded the edges off of his aggressively experimental cinema. I quite willingly embarked on the 70 minute masochism that is &lt;em&gt;Goodbye to Language 3D&lt;/em&gt;. The mischief this time includes an assaultive sound design that punched new holes in my ears and splitting the dual camera system required for native 3D to create double exposure images that effectively raped my retinas. Not to mention the philosophical debates between a naked man and woman while they were expelling a case of the runs (which at least meant the fart sounds were coming from within the film, for once ). There were also some gem lines of spastic voiceover dialogue, saying how &amp;quot;Images are the murder of the present&amp;quot;, and how &amp;quot;soon everyone will need an interpreter to understand the words coming out of their own mouth&amp;quot;. Only Godard could make these statements ring so true.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Sunshine Superman</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so so so sorry. I don&amp;#39;t know what happened to me. Well, yes I do. I was rushing into the screening - pulled pork sandwich dripping in-hand - because I didn&amp;#39;t want to miss a moment. Good thing, too, because the visual treats in &lt;em&gt;Sunshine Superman&lt;/em&gt; come fast and early. You couldn&amp;#39;t ask for a more visual subject than a documentary about the first BASE jumpers. Especially one that follows Carl, and accomplished director of (free-fall) photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as I sat there being consumed by the story, I also had to wolf down some lunch. Quickly, too, so I could capture some quotes from these odd balls in the late 70s who parachuted off cliffs and buildings. And as the story reached it&amp;#39;s ominous ending, I couldn&amp;#39;t dare leave. Which is why, in the film&amp;#39;s most dramatic and extended silent pause, I accidentally let one rip. Hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not in my head. People turned around three rows away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, I&amp;#39;m coming clean. If someone complains that the screening stunk, it wasn&amp;#39;t the film. It was me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Force Majeure</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This is what I come here to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Force Majeure&lt;/em&gt; made waves at Cannes, and deserves a much bigger audience than the Swedish family drama will probably find. Tense and hilarious, Ruben Östlund has crafted a damn-near perfect exploration of modern masculinity and heterosexual relationships. The film is laser-focused on the very filmic principle that action reveals character, and entertainingly explores how a single instinct can overpower our entire understanding of a another human being. If only the film had stuck to its guns and ended one scene earlier to maintain the principle indictment, I would have fallen for the film whole-heatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Dead Lands</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The first ever film in the Maori language? And it’s all about Maori warriors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sign me up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film was getting some nice buzz before the festival, largely because it was singled out by your head programmer, Cameron Bailey, as one to watch. But does it elevate itself past the novelty factor of a Kiwi beefcake action film? Not really. But it doesn&amp;#39;t disappoint, either. The (many) fight scenes aren&amp;#39;t always well framed, but it&amp;#39;s satisfyingly bloody and often eye-opening (watching a Maori warrior take a shit on the skull of his ancestor will have that effect). All the macho posturing before battle – the literal tongue-wagging – worked for me, and represents the kind of fare you showcase so well: audience-friendly films that might otherwise get lost in the shuffle. &lt;/p&gt;
