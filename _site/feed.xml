				<title>The Captive</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have one big question for you: was the use of flashbacks and flash-forwards in &lt;em&gt;The Captive&lt;/em&gt; your idea? Or was it director Atom Egoyan&amp;#39;s? I&amp;#39;m curious to know whether this was part of the screenplay&amp;#39;s original structure, or if it was a choice made during post-production, mainly because it seems to be the most divisive aspect of the film. I can&amp;#39;t decide how I feel about it, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that telling the story this way forced me to think a little harder about what I was watching. This is not a criticism in and of itself, except that I&amp;#39;m not sure it was always necessary. Sometimes the temporal shifts felt like &amp;quot;a gimmick, a trick you didn&amp;#39;t need&amp;quot; (like Ryan Reynolds and his young daughter so aptly discuss during the scene right before she disappears).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there&amp;#39;s also serious confusion surrounding important plot points and when they actually take place. &lt;em&gt;(SPOILER ALERT!)&lt;/em&gt; It takes a long time, for instance, to reveal &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; Nicole, the detective played by Rosario Dawson, was actually kidnapped. This is the focus of the first scene of the film, but only actually happens last, chronologically - and this reveal feels anticlimactic after all the tension of trying to place it within the correct sequence of events, especially since it&amp;#39;s only a subplot to Cassandra&amp;#39;s disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, after I&amp;#39;d finished the film, when I really thought about it, this story device reminded me of the way my mind works when I obsess about something, thinking about it to the point of being overwhelmed, jumping from detail to memory to detail in no specific order while trying to figure out why something bad happened, something over which I ultimately had no control. So if that&amp;#39;s the feeling you were going for - a feeling of tense, OCD-like worry - then kudos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I enjoyed the film, but can&amp;#39;t quite figure out how I feel about this method of storytelling. Was it a gimmick you didn&amp;#39;t need, or a great trick for helping us empathize with the characters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Diane Carol Harder&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Look of Silence</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Few documentaries warrant a sequel. Then again, few documentaries are landmark cinematic achievements like &lt;em&gt;The Act of Killing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joshua Oppenheimer&amp;#39;s new film, &lt;em&gt;The Look of Silence&lt;/em&gt;, once against takes us into the dark and disgraceful period of Indonesian history, face-to-face with the genocidal madmen who still hold political power 40 years after their crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living up to &lt;em&gt;The Act of Killing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s innovative and subversive storytelling tactics might not be possible, but &lt;em&gt;The Look of Silence&lt;/em&gt; breaks new ground by actually confronting the killers about their crimes. Once again risking his life, along with dozens of others who helped make the film (as before, many are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/9/13/the-act-of-killing.html&quot;&gt;credited as &amp;quot;Anonymous&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;), Oppenheimer gives us a brave central character to get behind: Adi, a man whose brother was brutally slaughtered by the paramilitary death squads.It&amp;#39;s as shocking and provocative as its predecessor, while still standing alone as an artistic and activist triumph.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Rosewater</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So you didn&amp;#39;t land the world premiere of &lt;em&gt;Rosewater&lt;/em&gt;. Not even the North American premiere, actually. So what if the story is about an Iranian-Canadian journalist. And big deal that everyone is curious about what Jon Stewart brings to his first film as writer and director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a super sarcastic set-up from &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt; (those can be extremely dangerous, after all). After seeing the picture, there&amp;#39;s no sense losing sleep over the fact that you made us thesecond (gasp!) audience to see this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t be hard for journalists to get excited about the tale of Mazir Bahari. The film does a great job of lauding the dangerous risks that the press faces abroad. Especially since the film does so without ever becoming saccharine or sanctimonious. On the other hand, there isn&amp;#39;t enough going on at a plot level to warrant such a big production (a good metaphor for the Bahari&amp;#39;s imprisonment, actually). Because footage from &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt; was used to accuse Bahari of being a U.S. spy, I understand why Stewart felt a need to make the film. I&amp;#39;m just not sure many other&amp;#39;s will feel the need to see it—especially once the novelty wares off.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>&#39;71</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not usually a fan of war movies (don&amp;#39;t tell anyone, but still haven&amp;#39;t seen&lt;em&gt;Saving Private Ryan&lt;/em&gt;), but you definitely got my attention with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in the early days of The Troubles in Belfast, a rookie British soldier finds himself lost and alone in IRA-controlled territory. I was on the edge of my seat as he dodged through alleyways, attempting to find his way back to his barracks while trying to avoid getting shot by zealots. And I sincerely appreciated how complicated the politics were—and that no one in this battle was wholly innocent (except, maybe, our protagonist).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If more combat films could be like this – tense thrillers that are more about survival than destruction – I might just become a convert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				<title>Corbo</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The October Crisis has inspired some of Canada&amp;#39;s finest films. Michel Brault&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Les ordres&lt;/em&gt; and Pierre Falardeau&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Octobre&lt;/em&gt; are the most notable, and despite their propaganda-like levels of sympathy for the FLQ and Quebec sovereignty movement, they&amp;#39;re undeniably great cinematic experiences. &lt;em&gt;Corbo&lt;/em&gt; may not achieve such heights, but it&amp;#39;s certainly worthy of being grouped in this elite class of &amp;quot;distinctly&amp;quot; Quebec cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film canonizes teenagers in the 1960s who were willing to kill complete strangers to promote the separatist movement. This makes the film&amp;#39;s inclusion in Canada&amp;#39;s premiere film festival sound strange on paper, but adding &lt;em&gt;Corbo&lt;/em&gt; to the line-up is far from a political statement. It&amp;#39;s a well-crafted period film that takes its characters and politics dead serious. I haven&amp;#39;t seen (or even heard of) writer and director Mathieu Denis&amp;#39; only other feature film, Laurentie. But after seeing &lt;em&gt;Corbo&lt;/em&gt;, he&amp;#39;s one to watch out for. In a good way.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>TIFF 2014: Day Seven</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Our postcard dispatches form the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival for Wednesday, September 10.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Nightcrawler</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;That first clap you heard when the screening was over? That was me. And the sigh of relief right afterwards? That was me, too. I was waiting to find the film at this year&amp;#39;s festival that I&amp;#39;d flip over, and I finally did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fearless and fascinating characters, a gripping plot, biting satire, a wicked sense of humor—&lt;em&gt;Nightcrawler&lt;/em&gt; almost feels like this year&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Spring Breakers&lt;/em&gt; ( &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/3/28/spring-breakers.html&quot;&gt;high praise, indeed&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the opening scene, Dan Gilroy, in his directorial debut, makes a statement that anything can and will happen. Jake Gyllenhaal takes his creepiness to just the right places in this film about a man who&amp;#39;s looking for a job – any job, really – that will suit his yet-to-be-defined skills and bald-faced ambition. Needless to say, he finds something he&amp;#39;s rather perfect for. My spoiler-phobic instincts allowed me to experience every moment with complete surprise, and I was swept away by the excitement. Now I&amp;#39;m turning all my enthusiasm into word-of-mouth buzz, so people can hopefully avoid the terribly revealing trailer for a film that goes way-too-deep into the third act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People should just trust me – and you – and check out this film. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Manglehorn</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This might not be fair, but I&amp;#39;m getting a bit tired of all the gloomy character dramas dominating this year&amp;#39;s line-up. I understand why actors are drawn to stories that prioritize the &amp;quot;who&amp;quot; of a story over the &amp;quot;what&amp;quot;, but as an audience member, I&amp;#39;m starting to crave a good, juicy, vigorous plot. Sadly, that&amp;#39;s not the case with &lt;em&gt;Manglehorn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Gordon Green has made a return to the serious side of things with a movie about an old curmudgeon forced to soften up in his twilight years ( &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/9/5/tiff-2014-day-two.html#st-vincent&quot;&gt;sound familiar&lt;/a&gt;?). He&amp;#39;s a romantic who can&amp;#39;t get over a lost love. So much so that he&amp;#39;s completely oblivious to the charms of the new woman in his life, played by Holly Hunter. The film is small in scale, but not without some charming moments (like a spontaneous musical outburst in a bank), and one strangely ambitious transition shot of a highway traffic pile-up (which probably cost the film half its budget). But aside from these nice flourishes, there&amp;#39;s not a whole lot to get excited about—with the exception of Holly Hunter, of course, who the festival (and the world) can always use a little more of.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Kahlil Gibran&#39;s The Prophet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of an animated feature based on &lt;em&gt;The Prophet&lt;/em&gt;, Kahlil Gibran&amp;#39;s collection of poetic essays, was enough to spark my curiosity while selecting my festival fare this year. Though a few lines and passages from the book have stayed with me over the years, I&amp;#39;m not really one for poetry. It doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;come alive&amp;#39; for me very easily. But today was the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part poetry reading, part art gallery tour, part Yo Yo Ma concert, the film compiles chapters from the book into animated segments, each rendered by different artists. All of this is framed around the central narrative of a young girl who befriends a poet and political prisoner. That said poet is voiced by Liam Neeson was, admittedly, another huge draw for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibran&amp;#39;s text leaps to life in vivid colour, and my concern of too many things being attempted at once was soon forgotten. I realized it was best to simply succumb to the film&amp;#39;s interweaving elements, absorb the richness of the imagery and sound, and process it all afterwards. Although the main narrative is initially weak compared to the individual segments, it builds into a thoroughly moving conclusion, leaving me, admittedly, a little teary-eyed as I emerged from the theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you happen to know who I need bribe to get Liam Neeson to come to my house and read me poetry, please, hook a girl up.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Second Chance</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Susanne Bier&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;A Second Chance&lt;/em&gt; was perhaps a bleak choice to kick off my TIFF 2014 selections, but it set the bar pretty high. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau plays a policeman who does something drastic and inadvisable when tragedy strikes at home. Though my viewing companion was desperate for even a few moments of levity, I was waiting for the film to veer off into overwrought melodrama which, thankfully, it didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any story centered upon the endangerment or harming of children elicits an intensely visceral response, with little room or patience for nuance. Care is taken to present the character&amp;#39;s actions while underscoring their vulnerabilities, commanding compassion from the viewer rather than revulsion. Full credit goes to Bier for the restraint and sensitivity with which she treats the subject and her characters.&lt;/p&gt;
